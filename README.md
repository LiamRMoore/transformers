# Learn Transformers

*This is a fork of [James Calam's Transformers course repo](https://github.com/jamescalam/transformers)* which uses an docker image based on the HuggingFace Transformers image with GPU support along with poetry to provide a more complete and  reproducible environment across different platforms.

Here are the updated [installation instructions](installation.md).

## TODO:

- Finish section 9 assignment
- Finish sections 11 and 12
- Update pyproject.toml with valid sentence transformers, haystack etc. test earlier notebooks to ensure a simple build installs everything.
- *Optional* clean up notebooks and code therein, incl. new simpler APIs for tokenizers etc
