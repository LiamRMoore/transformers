t3_wg6ntw|1659633128.0|investing|Is this the end of the traditional stock market?|"Please consider the following points from a person who has very little understanding of macroeconomics and the geopolitical situation, let alone the trends in the foreseeable future.

Lately I'm getting two really bad feelings about the current situation:

1. Everywhere I read that the stock market is oversaturated with investors, it's easier than ever to enter it, and the trend of investing in the stock market (and investing in general) had risen dramatically over the past few years. I've read that because of the over-saturation, the entire market in itself is overvalued, and some analysts predict that the economy has overextended, and we're in for a downturn with no recovery in the forceable future (more on that in the second point). A good example is the ""tech bubble"" or the ""crypto rush"" that are very reminding of the dotcom bubble.
2. The current geopolitical events are very bearish, aside from the Ukraine war which brings a supply shortage in some commodities, the US-Chine situation and generally the climate situation, which we can see the consequences of in the present, and the recession, and seems as though things are not going to go well in the near future, I understand that in the grand scheme of things, these events bring short-term market downturn, but with the climate situation, it seems we'll get shorter and shorter of resources.

Can there be a situation that the market will under-perform for tens of years? could we have reached the top?"|0.37|0.0|0.0|0.0|[]

t3_wezeun|1659509460.0|investing|Intel hit 4% div yield, but can it keep paying it|"Recently released financials from Intel disappointed investors. The figures turned out to be much worse than expected and the share price flew down.  When the share price falls, the dividend yield naturally rises. But the question sharply arises - ""can the company continue to pay and increase its dividend payments"".

 I use 3 groups of indicators to determine the financial stability of a company:  Liquidity, Financial stability and  Profitability Ratios.

Liquidity:

Cash Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 0,2

Quick Ratio = Cash + Cash Equivalents + Short-term Investments + Accounts Receivable ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 1,0

Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities, must be &gt; 2,0

**According to the latest reports, Intel is on the borderline of liquidity and starts running out of money (FCF TTM -1 522 also tells it):**

Cash Ratio = 0,16 **&lt; 0,2**

Quick Ratio = 0,99 **&lt; 1.0**

Current Ratio = 1,85 **&lt; 2,0**

&amp;#x200B;

Financial stability:

Equity Ratio = Total Equity ÷ Total Assets, must be &gt; 0,4

Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Assets, must be &lt; 0,6

Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity, must be 0,4 - 1,0, but &lt; 1,5

Interest coverage ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expenses, must be &gt; 1,5

**Intel is financially stable and able to pay current dividend levels in the near future** 

Equity Ratio = 0.59 &gt; 0,4

Debt Ratio = 0,4 &lt; 0,6

Debt to Equity = 0,68 

Interest coverage ratio = 17,3

&amp;#x200B;

Profitability:

Gross Profit Margin % = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue

Operating Profit Margin % = Operating Profit ÷ Revenue

Net Profit Margin % = Net Income ÷ Revenue 

ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Income ÷ Total Assets

ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Income ÷ Average Shareholder’s Equity

Profitability ratios should be compared with other companies in the sector in order to determine the place among competitors, here the numbers for Intel - AMD - Nvidia (because you like to compare them):

Gross Profit Margin = 49,8% &gt; 48,5% &lt; 65,25%

Operating Profit Margin = 18,8% &lt; 20,8% &lt; 33,6%

Net Profit Margin = 26% &gt; 17,9% &lt; 32%

ROA = 11,2% &gt; 5% &lt; 31,9%

ROE = 19,4% &gt; 10,8% &lt; 35,7%

Nvidia beats all, but Intel looks also good.

https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2022/0802

&gt;	**Inspecting Individual Recession Indicators**


&gt;The NBER committee’s indicators used to date business cycles include real (inflation-adjusted) personal income minus transfers, nonfarm payroll employment, employment as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics household survey, real personal consumption expenditures, wholesale-retail sales adjusted for price changes and industrial production.

&gt;The gray lines in Chart 1 show the movements of nonfarm payrolls and industrial production in each previous business cycle relative to the peak of that cycle (month 0 = 100); the average across all previous cycles is the black line. The 2020 COVID-19-induced recession is excluded because its cause, scale and timing were extremely atypical. The red line is the indicator’s movement between June 2021 and June 2022 relative to the level in December 2021.

&gt;	The data show that employment in the overall economy and output of the industrial sector in 2022 have significantly outperformed what occurred during every previous recession at a similar point. Chart 2 repeats this exercise for an alternate source of employment (surveying households rather than businesses) and for manufacturing and trade sales.

&gt;	While these indicators in 2022 (red line) are not as starkly above the gray recession lines as the indicators in Chart 1, their paths remained at the higher end of the distribution and were notably higher than the corresponding average recession paths. These indicators are also more volatile than their counterparts in Chart 1, with a wider range of recessionary outcomes.

&gt;Finally, Chart 3 shows a similar pattern as Chart 2 for real consumption and real personal income excluding transfers.


——-


&gt;	**Low Unemployment Rate Is Also Argument Against Recession**


&gt;While not listed among the indicators considered by the NBER committee, the unemployment rate is also among the indicators pointing to labor market strength through the first half of 2022 (Chart 5, Panel B). It has declined from 3.9 percent in December 2021 to 3.6 percent in March 2022, where it has held steady through June. By month six, every other recession incurred an unemployment rate increase of at least 0.3 percentage points.

&gt;Increases in unemployment may also better match conceptually what is generally understood to mean a recession—an increase in slack or underutilization of resources rather than a decline in economic activity. As trend GDP growth slows due to aging demographics and slower productivity gains, there may be more frequent periods of negative GDP growth without an increase in unemployment, making the distinction between increasing slack and declining activity more relevant than in the past.

I deposited 5000 CHF (Swiss Francs) into my TD Ameritrade account, and used the international wire transfer instructions they gave. They stated that the banks they work with don't charge any fees, but that our own bank might. 
For CHF to USD transfers, you’re supposed to wire the money to Citibank London, so I did that. 
I then noticed that in another document, they contradicted themselves and said the two banks they work with for wire transfers don’t charge any fees (Citibank was not one of those).

Based on the exchange rates around the time I deposited the money, I should have gotten at least $5150. Certainly never less than $5000. I ended up with about $4960 on my account. 

I reached out to my bank asking if they use an intermediary bank and they clearly stated that they had sent 5000 Swiss Francs to Citibank London, without converting them of subtracting any fees.

l asked Ameritrade if I could see any statement regarding potential fees from Citibank or the conversion rate, and they said they didn't have access to that, but
also made it VERY clear that I should not contact Citibank London directly.

Are hidden fees for wire transfers like this common? Is it safer to convert my own money and then deposit it directly?

I had a question regarding the cash flow statement (as presented in GAAP/SEC financials). What would/could cause the stated change in accounts receivable on the cash flow statement to be different from the actual change on the balance sheet?

If it’s helpful, I’ll detail the specific situation below but I’ve now noticed that this is far from uncommon, I can find plenty of companies where the change in A/R on the cash flow statement is significantly different from the change on the balance sheet.

For reference, I was looking at Enphase Energy. 12/31/2021 A/R on the balance sheet was $333.6m and was $312.5m as of Q2. Intuitively, I would have expected the cash flow statement to add $21.2m to account for this decrease. In actuality, the cash flow statement (for the entire 6-month period, not just Q2) adds $27.5m of cash and I can’t figure out where the additional $6.4m would have came from. 

What would cause this and is there any way to find out more detail? I can’t find any supporting information in the SEC docs.

 Aug 2 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [**(UBER.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/UBER.N) on Tuesday reported positive quarterly cash flow for the first time ever and forecast third-quarter operating profit above estimates, betting on steady demand for its ride-hailing and food-delivery services.

Uber shares, which have lost more than 40% this year, surged 15% to $28.41 in premarket trading and helped drive an 8% gain in rival Lyft Inc's shares.

Uber generated free cash flow of $382 million in the second quarter, topping analysts' expectations of $263.2 million, as trips exceeded pre-pandemic levels, boosted by the reopening of offices and a surge in travel demand."|0.96|1714.0|0.0|1714.0|"['Reuters', ""Lyft Inc's""]"

I have this question that I can't seem to wrap my head around. 

Currently, I have two investment accounts which I contribute to monthly (one account managed by a broker, one account I buy ETFs in myself). Since these are both heavily invested in similar ETFs and aimed at the long-term, I have been considering combining them into one account.  So, of course I want to obtain the greatest yields and I understand the importance of compound interest. Using some calculators I computed the speculated yield over a period of 10 years for both accounts. 

However, I was wondering if the generated compound interest would be greater if the assets of the accounts were combined. On the one hand my understanding of compound interest is that a larger starting capital will lead to a greater ""snowball surface"" able to collect more compound interest. On the other hand, I feel like two halves will generate the same combined interest when ultimately added up. I have not been able to find a satisfactory answer using compound interest calculators myself, so I hoped you guys could enlighten me!

Either moral reasons, because you want your investments to go towards a better future. Or financial reasons, because it is likely that clean energies will in the future represent a much bigger market share.

In particular, solar energy has been growing a lot over the past 10 years. See for example Nextera (NEP @ NYSE) with +100% in 5 years (on top of dividends) and many other examples (BEP, CWEN, ...).     

There are also some UFOs like ENPH @ NASDAQ, with +30'000% in 5 years, or DQ @ NYSE with +1000% in the same time period. Insane gains if you manage to board the train early. 

Even Big Oil says they are working on it - whether you believe them or not is another question. TotalEnergies (TTE @ NYSE) may be serious about it, and while their stock does not grow, a 5-6% dividend yield is nothing to laugh at.

As oil prices soar and natural gas is getting rarer due to the war, maybe even more people are willing to give clean energies a try. In that case the best opportunity was probably in February 2022, but it is not impossible that it keeps growing steadily in the future.

* 

Do you invest in clean energies? Why/why not?

If you do - do you go with specific companies? Look up for UFOs ? Established, ""safe"" ones?  Or rather do you go for ETFs?

t3_wdg0an|1659356104.0|investing|Small Cap Value ETF paradox?|"This is probably an incredibly stupid thought/question but here goes:

If a fund or ETF is focused on Small Cap stocks this means it likely tracks an index such as Russell 2000 or S&amp;P Small Cap 600 for its benchmark. To satisfy the ""value"" part of it, an actively managed fund such as AVUV or passively managed fund such as SLYV will target companies that are attractively undervalued and priced as such. 

The expectation here (I assume) is that these companies will outperform over time and provide a return for investors. 

However, is there a paradox here? If a company lives up to its classification of being undervalued and ends up outperforming , i.e. share price rises to be more in line with its intrinsic value or even more so if the company scales or something, doesn't this change how the stock is classified (maybe becoming a mid cap growth etc) and thus will be rebalanced out of the funds holdings? 

My thought is that sure, if this happens, the fund will benefit from the realized gain and be able to re-invest that capital into other small caps, increasing AUM, and rinse repeat.

But isn't the Investor now missing out on the continued price appreciation of the stock in its new category? (Let's assume the investor doesn't hold other broad funds or ETFs)  Maybe it was undervalued at $10/share, but is fairly valued at $20/share but will really see its run from $20 to $80/share?

Maybe ""growth"" is the wrong term. Maybe they have already experienced their growth phase as microcaps and have settled into their stride as eternally small cap companies under $2bn.

Still my stupid question remains - In order to capture the full potential of a small cap value stock, doesn't the Investor need to keep track of when an ETF rebalances stocks out of its holdings and attempt to capture that value via a crossover ETF or by directly purchasing the individual stock?

I mean, I keep an eye on the holdings of the diversified ETFs I hold, but I never specifically thought about if I should attempt to capture the specific life of a stock as it moves through different caps and classifications.  That's why I hold ETFs - because I don't trust that I'd be able to pick individual winners consistently that will beat a risk adjusted index return.  

Doesn't this create a paradox though, where I AM attempting to pick stocks, increasing my risk, the opposite of what ETF investing is supposed to be accomplishing? 

What is the proper way to approach this? Apologies if conceptually this is all incorrect and I should just be focusing on the historical and expected returns of any given set of ETFs that fit my strategy.  Even so, I don't like the idea of missing a young Amazon that today is small and undervalued but next year trades at a high P/E and is no longer in the ETF where it started.

I did not expect the amount of response on my original post, I think when originally creating the post and being new to the sub that it wouldn't garner much attention, in my lack of detail I think some missed key points of my original discussion.

AMD which was 100% of my portfolio in my ROTH, but only 10% of my overall investments, I thought that having it in my ROTH would be really beneficial as I can avoid taxes, however after reading hundreds of responses there are many more disadvantages to having a concentrated portfolio of any kind.
- Inability to claim losses to offset capital gains tax
- 6,000 contribution limit makes it very costly in any loss scenario as with a 10% average market appreciation 6k over many years, and diversified will always yield positive returns, where as an individual stock is gambling.

I was given the advice to move AMD to my retail account where I've held my full 102 share stake, but I've sold ETFs and now my ROTH IRA is 100% SPY until I have more time to find ETFs that diversify my portfolio with less expense rates as there are many funds I wasn't currently aware of.

Another tip given by a CFP (Certified Financial Planner) is that I max my 401k, but instead of using my pre-tax traditional 401k I just do both roth.
-Swapped Pre-Tax 401k traditional to Post Tax Roth 401k
- Changed my 401k contribution to the maximum allowed, while taking the most advantage of my employer match

I originally thought I was making the smart play by avoiding taxes, but in reality I was going to pay more taxes if I ended up losing money because I could no longer recoup my losses against my capital gains.

It was also brought to my attention that some thought a 25% concentration in Ethereum was a lot, which I do agree as it heavily correlates with tech, it isn't liquidable because it's staked so I have no way of moving this allocation around but I plan on lower it to 10% and adding to my brkb and taking a stake in some dividend etfs, once I do more research. I'll do a complete portfolio explanation once I have time to research and find a mix that I think suitably diversifes risk while giving exposure to more sectors.

Thanks for the advice everyone. I appreciate it, also I didn't wake up until 10am so I made a little extra profit in my ROTH before I sold :)

If anyone has any advice on ETFs to research or constructive criticism Im all ears, I know some critized me selling covered calls against my shares to reduce my risk, if anyone else has any ideas to hedge my risk in a more profitable way I'd love to learn.


Update: I'm going to sell a call for my target price a month out, if the guidance is bad I'll use the premium decay to recover some losses, if it's good then I'll either be called out or roll my call over to whatever I see as my new price target each month. Wish me luck :)

I'm 23 years old and make around 80,000-100,000$ a year, just recently started putting money into a  Roth IRA last year, right now I have 9600\~ in AMD stock and I really like the stock. I've traded a few stocks here and there but AMD is my top stock to own right now, I put 7% of my paycheck into my 401k from work, and save around 90% of my money in long term investments. I only have the Roth IRA to really invest in my own opinions, the others are all just ETF's in my other accounts.   
What do you guys think about having 100% of a Roth IRA in a single stock?   
I like to trade in Roth IRA because of tax advantages and ability to withdraw deposits.    
Please don't clown on me, I just am genuinely curious as to how others, older than me balance their  IRA's and if anyone had bad/good experiences in their life with it.  
Also yes, I sell covered calls against my shares every week.

Teacher switching careers and leaving the education field for a myriad of reasons - loved the job, hating the profession. I finished my 10th year but unfortunately 4 of those years were at a private parochial school so I unfortunately won't qualify for a pension distribution upon retirement age. I'll be getting the money (about $20,000) out of there as soon as my final summer paychecks stop coming through.

Current plan: I wanted to convert the capital into a Roth IRA and spread the funds (about $20,000) into various REITs with monthly distributions for faster DRIP compounding for the next 30 years - or really until I die. 

My hope is of course to create a steady dividend income stream upon retirement so that when I pass, the core of the nest egg will still be there for my children. I will also have a Roth IRA set up with my new employer and they have a company match on any contributions I make - which is why I wanted to start this non-employer Roth IRA and just leave it rather than get conservative with it closer to retirement age and reinvest it all into more stable things like bonds or whatever. 

No this isn't a recommendation for tickers or anything like that - just seeking thoughts on this situation and general plan for the funds. And I probably won't actually execute this until the housing market shows the effects of the current state of inflation &amp; recession buzz and hopefully capitalize on a good price entry opportunity on some kind of major correction or (unfortunate) housing collapse.

I started investing a while ago, first through an expensive broker where I live and then switched to Interactive Brokers. 

Before starting my journey with stocks and ETF‘s I had bought som Ethereum coins a while back and was always impressed how easy it was. I could watch the order book update in real time, see what orders got executed and it just made sense. 

With IBKR I get shown some outdated prices, the order book sometimes just looks very strange and I think there is no way to see what orders got executed for which prices in the last hour or so. 

And I am wondering: why is that?

Why is it so damn difficult to see what you‘re doing when placing an order? 

Example: it often happens that my ETF of choice trades at, say, $140.40 (last price), the book shows 140.55 as the lowest ask, I place my order at 140.55 but it won‘t get executed right away. Why does it not?? Maybe there is something about the order flow I don‘t get.

* Supply-side inflation: there is a dearth of resources/goods/services, and people are willing to pay a higher price for every bit they can get. Rising prices does not stop people from buying and bidding higher, which creates an inflation spiralling out of control. Raising interest rates in such an environment would do little, will it not? Currently, it's the risk of extended war and resurgence in demand after COVID that can contribute to an inflation surge powered by an inability of the global supply chain to meet these demands.

* Demand-side inflation: people have more to spend, because money was available so cheaply. There is lot more debt than can be financed, and once the Feds/central banks raise rates, after some defaults, things go back to ""normal"". Demand adjusts to a level that normalises the prices and inflation kind of just dissipates. People are not buying stuff out of desperation, they just wanted to raise their standard of living.

What kind of inflation are we in? Investing in Supply-side inflation seems kind of profitable for some companies (they can increase prices without damaging revenue) but overall it seems a terrible situation. Demand-side inflation seems more healthy and generally good time to, ""buy the dips"".

Inflation is always presented as this ""invisible evil force"" that is bad and ever-present danger, but inflation is driven by us, the humans. Why do people keep buying at higher and higher prices?

t3_w9slrk|1658962275.0|investing|The 8 economists who decide if the U.S. is in a recession|" (The Washington Post) -- The 8 economists who decide if the U.S. is in a recession

Democrats  and Republicans have begun arguing over whether the U.S. economy is in a  recession ahead of a key data release on Thursday. But the official  pronouncement will ultimately come down to a little-known group of  economists selected by the National Bureau of Economic Research called  the “Business Cycle Dating Committee,” which stubbornly takes its time  and tries to wall itself off from political interference or attempts to  spin its findings.

The  stakes for the group are high, in part because of the extraordinarily unusual economic conditions two years after the last recession, early in the coronavirus pandemic. The economy contracted in the first quarter  of the year, and many Republicans say a recession is here already, with  Thursday’s release expected by many analysts to show a second  consecutive quarter of negative growth. But from President Biden down,  administration officials are instead pointing to other indicators  showing the economy remains strong and insisting the committee would be wrong to declare a recession.

The  political haggling is not supposed to matter to the eight economists  who rule on when recessions start. Their decision is almost certainly  months away, if it comes at all: The committee typically waits long  after a recession has begun to declare it, only acting when the evidence  has become overwhelming, sometimes even after the recession is already  over. That puts the pressure bearing down on the organization from the  outside — to promptly render a verdict on one of the most important  matters facing economic policymakers — directly at odds with its mission  to provide unassailable empirical decisions.

As  a result, what seems like a straightforward question — is the U.S.  economy in a recession? — is in part decided on a subjective basis at a  later date, sometimes when it no longer appears pertinent, by experts in  closed-door meetings of a privately selected committee.

“By  far, the most important thing to try to convey is that the committee is  not trying to do real-time dating of whether we’re in a recession,”  said MIT economics professor James Poterba, the NBER president and a  member of the committee, in an interview. “There’s often enormous amount  of interest in that question and what many people are hoping for, but  the committee’s task is to create a consistent historical record of the  turning points — the peaks and the troughs in the U.S. economy.”

The  group’s calculus could become increasingly fraught in the following  months, amid puzzling economic conditions that defy easy  characterization. The political consequences for the committee could be  significant, as the Biden administration faces growing public anger over  high inflation and its economic stewardship. Congressional Republicans  will also be eager to seize on a ruling that the economy is in a  recession, trying to capitalize on voter discontent ahead of this fall’s  midterm elections.

Asked  about the upcoming economic numbers, Biden on Monday disputed the  notion that a recession was imminent. That is part of a broader  administration campaign in recent weeks to rebut GOP claims that a  recession has already begun. Top economic officials, including Treasury  Secretary Janet L. Yellen and White House National Economic Council  Director Brian Deese, appeared on cable TV news Sunday and Monday to  reiterate their view that the U.S. economy is not technically in  recession — and wouldn’t be even if the GDP numbers show a second  consecutive quarter of contraction.

This  strategy has its risks, though, because if the United States does enter  a recession later, their current assurances will look misguided —  particularly after the administration already incorrectly dismissed the  threat of inflation last year.

“We’re  not going to be in a recession, in my view. The \[unemployment\] rate is  still one of the lowest we’ve had in history,” Biden said on Monday. “My  hope is we go from this rapid growth to steady growth.”

At  the core of the challenge facing the committee of economists is that it  relies on more than a half-dozen criteria to measure when a recession  has begun. The general impression many Americans — and some commentators  — have is that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of  negative economic growth. But that is not how the NBER, or most  economists, think of it. Instead, the committee weighs factors such as  payroll levels, retail sales, industrial production and personal income  when making a comprehensive assessment about whether the economy is in  recession. The committee stresses on its website that “there is no fixed  rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how  they are weighted in our decisions.”

As  Deese told CNN: “In terms of the technical definition, it’s not a  recession — the technical definition considers a much broader spectrum  of data points.”

Traditionally,  all these various economic metrics move in tandem, making the  committee’s job easier. Usually, when growth declines, so do employment,  consumer activity and the other measures of economic health. But the  economy since the start of the pandemic has confounded prior models and  may do so again. Economic growth may end up declining for two  consecutive quarters — although the first quarter in the United States  was negative due largely to technical factors, such as a temporary  uptick in overall imports — even as unemployment remains among the  lowest levels in American history. Consumer spending has remained  strong, too, in a way at odds with a typical recession. If unemployment  remains low even as growth contracts, the NBER economists could face a  vexing challenge in deciding how to categorize the situation.

Predicting  the committee’s decision is made more difficult by the way in which it  operates. As part of the NBER, the Business Cycle Dating Committee is  run by a private nonprofit group — not the federal government or a state  statistical agency. Its membership is selected by the president of the  NBER “in consultation” with the committee chair, according to Poterba.

The  committee’s meetings are not publicized. They’re held in a closed-door  conference room on the third floor of the Cambridge, Mass., office  building where NBER is headquartered. They don’t meet on a fixed  schedule: Board Chairman and Stanford economist Bob Hall is responsible  for calling the meetings. During long periods of consistent economic  growth, the board can go years without having anything to discuss, and  therefore, it might hold no meetings. It wouldn’t even confirm when past  meetings have happened.

“The committee does not announce its meeting schedule, and that’s something we don’t talk about,” Poterba said.

Its last public pronouncement came on July 19, 2021 — when [the committee declared](https://www.nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-july-19-2021) that there had been a recession between February and April 2020, the shortest one in U.S. history.

The  eight economists on the committee are among the most respected in their  field. Some have served in Democratic administrations, but past members  have also included GOP appointees. In addition to Poterba and Hall, the  members are Christina Romer and David Romer of the University of  California at Berkeley; James Stock, of Harvard; Robert Gordon, of  Northwestern; Valerie Ramey, of the University of California at San  Diego; and Mark Watson, of Princeton.

The  NBER has its roots in the period following World War I, after a  Columbia-trained economist who worked for labor and trade organizations  and the chief statistician at AT&amp;T formed a new organization after  realizing they had little shared empirical data with which to conduct  policy debates. In the early 1960s, the Commerce Department began  publishing a digest on business conditions that cited the NBER’s work on  the ups and downs of the business cycle, giving it a kind of federal  imprimatur, according to Poterba.

Poterba  stressed that the board is aware of public hunger for guidance about a  recession but does not let it dictate their decisions. Economic data is  often later revised, and the committee is careful not to announce a  verdict that is contingent on data that could later be changed.

“The  NBER is really trying to provide guideposts for researchers; it’s not  trying to provide short-term political talking points for either party,”  said Steve Miran, who served as a senior official in the Treasury  Department under Donald Trump’s administration and is the co-founder of  Amberwave Partners, an investment fund. “We’d all like it to be binary —  0 to 1, recession or not — but the truth is it’s much more of  continuum. It requires interpretation of the length, depth and speed of  the contraction, as well as which sectors of the economy are contracting  and why. … And that requires an element of judgment.”

Still,  that does not mean the board’s members are always in agreement. Harvard  economist Jeffrey Frankel, who served as a member of the committee for  roughly 25 years, said there is usually unanimity about the broad  questions of whether a recession is beginning or ending, but differences  can emerge about precisely what month a recession began or ended.

“There  are times when the right answer is not clear, and the kind of thing  there may be disagreement about is someone wanting more data — like  revisions to the \[gross domestic product\], for instance — and someone  else saying, ‘It’s already been 11 months, and if we wait longer people  will think the news will be too stale,’ ” Frankel said. “That tension is  always an issue.”

Nippon Steel just reached an agreement with Glencore to purchase power plant coal at $375/ton through March of 2023.

The agreement is three times more expensive than [similar deals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QUCZVTDWRGG3) done last year, and is likely one of the costliest coal contracts ever signed by a Japanese company, one of the people said."" -[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/glencore-strikes-one-of-japan-s-most-expensive-ever-coal-deals](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/glencore-strikes-one-of-japan-s-most-expensive-ever-coal-deals)

The Glencore deal may be used as a benchmark price for other thermal coal contracts across Asia increasing electricity-generation costs for households and industrial consumers. 

Also, when a first world importer commits itself to paying high-prices for a period of time, it can further impact inflation and have disastrous effects for the developing world, since third world countries won't be able to pay these prices. Prices can become increasingly entrenched when they are contractually obligated to persist.

Coal was previously seen as a means of producing low-cost electricity for developing nations. The Phillipines generates nearly 50% of it's electricity from coal powered sources and imports nearly 70% of it's coal consumption. Thailand generates nearly 20% of it's total electricity from coal-powered sources and imports 56% of it's consumption. Pakistan generates over 15% of it's electricity from coal-powered sources and imports \~70% of it's consumption. 

It's fair to assume that as prices increase for electricity generation, basic access to energy will decline as third-world countries will have difficulty maintaining grids.

· We are continuing process of significantly reducing our balance sheet. 

· Job growth is slower, but still robust

· Wage growth is increasing

· Inflation is well above goal 

· Although prices for some commodities have turned down, earlier surge has boosted prices, inflation pressure. 

· Another unusually large increase could be appropriate at next meeting. 

· Likely appropriate to slow increases at some point. 

· Further inflation surprises could be in store.

· Last inflation report was worse than expected. 

· It’s necessary to have growth slow down 

· We think we need a period of growth below potential to create some slack. 

· *STILL BELIEVE THERE IS A PATH TO RESTORE PRICE STABILITY AND BRING INFLATION DOWN WITHOUT CAUSING A RECESSION.*

· *I DO NOT THINK THE US IS CURRENTLY IN A RECESSION WITH HOW GOOD THE LABOR MARKET IS.*

· Getting down to new balance sheet equilibrium could take 2 – 2.5 years.

In taking the benchmark overnight borrowing rate up to a range of 2.25%-2.5%, the moves in June and July represent the most stringent consecutive moves since the Fed began using the overnight funds rate as the principal tool of monetary policy in the early 1990s.

When will it?|"According to the CDC, [the US has had ~1,140,000 excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) since February 1st 2020 than you would normally expect.

We also know that [95% of people](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-deaths-older-adults.html) killed by COVID-19 were 50 or older. [You can see granular breakdown here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex). The highest concentration was amongst the oldest people.

So since 2020 there has been a rather sudden change in the 50+ cohort of Americans.  I can't imagine that this is without consequence of some kind.

&gt; The average inheritance in 2019 was $212,854, up 45% from an inflation-adjusted $146,844 in 1998, according to an analysis of Fed data by economists at a unit of Capital One Financial Corp. [WSJ]

&gt; ...


&gt; Americans age 70 and above had a net worth of nearly $35 trillion, according to Federal Reserve data. That amounts to 27% of all U.S. wealth, up from 20% three decades ago. Their wealth is equal to 157% of U.S. gross domestic product, more than double the proportion 30 years ago, federal data show.

As this cohort dies, millennials and Gen Xers are set to get the largest wealth transfer in history. COVID jumpstarted it.

[~75% of Americans 55+ own a home](https://ipropertymanagement.com/research/homeownership-rate-by-age)

So one large question I have is what is happening with this inheritance?

How many excess houses were inherited because of COVID? Are the heirs moving into these houses? Are they offloading them for capital? How long does it take for them to begin to offload them, has it started/ended already? Will it impact the housing market?

How much excess equity was inherited because of COVID? Is it being offloaded relatively quickly or being held onto?

This was set up by my uncle and he had the idea to roll this into another product with the idea to take an initial 40k dispersement and draw down 7 percent while I collect some gains until the final year in which I receive a lump sum. All has seemed okay, risk is mitigated, I can see some gains. XYZ.

I have plans on building a beach house rental on land I own as well(should be no up front investment). I will need my emergency fund supplemented in this instance however and that will not allow me to currently meet my investment goals.

I presented the idea of taking 80k(51k after tax). instead of 40k, citing the compounded interest on a 20k investment with a measly 5% return after 30 years (additional money I would invest.) He strongly advised against it, even got snappy. Seemed to insinuate  if not guratnee  I'd see the same gains if not more(he said 10%) and saying that I am not taking in the tax ramifications into account. I smelt a salesman in an Uncle I trust. 

Right now I can purchase the Nationwide Heigher Heights 9 annuity or take 400000k over 5 years. 88k per year with a net of 250000. Doing the math the annuity IF IT PERFORMS at 3-10% could show me wonderful returns, but after yesterday I'm having second thoughts about the product all together. I'm starting to wonder if taking the 150k tax hit and having the capitol up front to invest through the next 5 to 10 years is a better move than rolling the dice with the annuity all together.

I know in the very least he was being disengenuos. I also recognize the product is offering value, Im gaining money tax deferred, but I'm wondering how much I stand to lose. He has pressed on the tax savings qd nauseum and I am starting to think this is a selling point.

AMSTERDAM/LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Not convinced by central banks' pledge to stamp on inflation, many investors are on the hunt for assets that will protect their portfolios from years of decline in the value of money.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding reason #1, part of the strategy of using a Cash Value Life Insurance Policy is to overfund your policy to maximize cash value that you may borrow against to fund real estate investments. On the surface, this seems like a reasonable idea to alleviate reason #1, but I don't know enough about the consequences/downsides of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have knowledge/experience regarding using Cash Value Life Insurance Policies as a tool in the context of real estate investing? Would love all feedback.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

During the quarter, Microsoft reduced its quarterly guidance for income and revenue because of changing foreign-exchange rates. CEO Satya Nadella said employees will get pay increases, and the company introduced services to help customers deal with security incidents.

When management lowered earnings expectations, though, it didn’t factor in other issues that could hurt results.

Technology industry researcher Gartner said earlier this month that logistical disruptions in the quarter had dragged down PC shipments, a key input for sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Plus, macroeconomic worries that hurt revenue growth for advertising-driven social-media companies Snap and Twitter could rub off on Microsoft. In 2021 the company generated $10 billion in advertising revenue before traffic-acquisition costs.

Microsoft shares have sold off 25% so far this year, compared with a decline of 17% for the S&amp;P 500 U.S. stock index.

I've called several times and each time I've tried I got a message that the estimated wait time exceeded their business hours and then the call was dropped. Finally I found the time to make the call early enough to be put into the queue. The recording said I had a ""2 or more"" hour wait but shrugged that off and strapped myself in Clockwork Orange style and took the beating of their over emphasized prerecording. After 92 minutes I got someone. Things were looking up I suppose.

Unfortunately that was about as far as my luck was taking me. I was told the refund process was being done manually and that they were processing through 10's of thousands of refunds and that the process had to involve a number of checks to make sure everything was being done properly and that it was being done on a first-come order. I asked if there was any estimate on when my refund would be processed, or if I could be given an idea on what date they were currently working through, but no luck. I asked if I could get a case number so that I could check in at a later time via email instead of waiting in the queue and again no luck. I asked finally if there was anything I could do either now or in the future to move this along, and again the answer was no. I did get the reassurance that the refund would eventually be processed and that if I wanted to assign it to a giftbox that I could do that. That is about the only escape from this that I could find, but unfortunately I've already allocated my giftbox for everyone for future years at this point. Instead of purchasing additional I-bonds while I waited for the refund, I should have tried contacting them sooner and not trusted their schedule.

TL;DR refunds are processed manually and you have no way of finding out when your refund will arrive. You can try calling 844-284-2676 and ask them to move your I-bonds into the giftbox for you instead of receiving the refund (all rules still apply), but expect a very long wait time and make sure to get into the queue early."|0.61|8.0|0.0|8.0|['Clockwork Orange', 'Treasury', 'TIN', 'TreasuryDirect']

CEO Tobi Lütke says company made wrong bet on pandemic-fueled boom in e-commerce growth lasting


[Source: CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6532165)

Ottawa-based e-commerce company Shopify Inc. is laying off roughly 1,000 people as explosive growth in the company's online selling business model slows.

""For a company like ours this news will be difficult to digest,"" founder and CEO Tobi Lütke said in an email to staff that was later published on the company's website.

According to regulatory filings, the company had about 10,000 employees at the end of 2021, twice the amount they had before the pandemic. The cuts amount to 10 per cent of the company's entire work force.

Affected staff are being notified on Tuesday. Most of the lay-offs will be in recruiting, support and sales, the company says.  Anyone affected will get 16 weeks of severance pay, plus an extra week for every year they've been with the company. And the company will remove limitations on any stock options they may be entitled to.

Like many digital-focused companies, Shopify saw demand for its services explode during the pandemic, as lockdowns forced consumers and businesses to adapt quickly to buying and selling online.

In response to this increased demand, Shopify expanded aggressively, hiring staff to keep up with the mass of new customers for its core service of helping real-world retailers sell goods online.

The boom was so massive that at one point in mid-2020, Shopify became the most valuable company in Canada, topping the Royal Bank of Canada, with a valuation of almost $300 billion.

While the uptick in sales and revenue was very real, maintaining that momentum proved difficult, as the company's growth showed signs of slowdown toward the end of 2021. Today, the company is worth about $50 billion. Shares in the company fell about 15 per cent when the TSX opened on Tuesday.

Shopify isn't the only tech company to feel the pinch of a slowdown. U.S. giants like Netflix, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Paypal all saw their prospects dim as the spectre of inflation took a bite out of consumer spending.

In his letter to staff, Lütke says demand for online shopping is growing, but no longer at the frenzied pace seen in 2020. All in all, e-commerce is about where it would have been had the pandemic surge not happened, he said.

Shopify had boosted its staffing levels on the assumption that explosive growth would continue.

""We bet that the .. share of dollars that travel through e-commerce rather than physical retail would permanently leap ahead,"" Lütke said. ""It's now clear that bet didn't pay off.""

The company is slated to reveal its quarterly results on Wednesday morning, and financial analysts who cover the company have been scrambling to downgrade their expectations."|0.96|664.0|0.0|664.0|['Microsoft', 'TSX', 'Netflix', 'Shopify Inc.', 'Apple', 'the Royal Bank of Canada', 'Google']

1. KULR announced securing a battery safety contract with NASA to test its lithium-ion cells for future battery packs designed for the Artemis Program, a series of US-led international human spaceflight programs. In that deal, KULR will be processing up to **10,000 lithium-ion cells per week and preparing for tests performed by NASA**, the Department of Defense, and others completing crewed flighted missions.  

2. KULR added an additional and potentially substantial revenue-generating shot on goal to its mix after releasing a passive propagation resistant (""PPR"") solution in its KULR-Tech Safe Case product family for maritime lithium-ion battery safety. This can be a big deal, noting that it's the only known PPR solution meeting the upcoming United States Coast Guard's new safety requirements for the passenger vessel industry.  

3. KULR has signed multi-million dollar contracts and is advancing development deals with industry behemoths, including NASA, Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT, $LMT), Johnson Controls, Leidos (NYSE: LDOS), and the Andretti United E Team racing group. Few, if any, other micro-cap names can come close to boasting a similar list  

4. KULR's recent acquisition of Centropy AB's innovative technologies also adds considerable value, both intrinsically and inherently. The thermal management technologies acquired through this deal can be seamlessly integrated into their existing portfolio of technologies and services for meeting demand in industries like **artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency mining** – each presenting significant new market opportunities.  

5. KULR has partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) to assist in their lithium-ion battery lifecycle initiative alongside Clarios. This initiative seeks to improve **lithium-ion battery production, recycling, and disposal practices**. With involvement in initiatives like this coming straight from the DoE, KULR is cementing itself as the go-to company for industry-specific battery safety and disposal services. And with billions of lithium-ion batteries being used, that position is enviable. [https://chartingdaily.com/revolutionary--battery-tech](https://chartingdaily.com/revolutionary--battery-tech)

The devaluation of the euro obviously has negative impacts on us Europeans, especially in international purchases that are made in dollars (e.g. energy), but it has also positive impacts on the export of our companies, which are able to be price-competitive due to a weaker euro and probably to present better results in euro currency balance sheets.

Therefore, I thought it might be a good idea for us Europeans to try to analyze medium-sized or large companies that could take advantage of the benefits associated with the euro devaluation.

Generally speaking, I set myself the goal of looking for and analyzing companies:

\- that export excellent products that would continue to be sold in the U.S. even in the case of the arrival of what seems to be the coming recession.

\- that by taking advantage of currency devaluation would be able to increase their market share in the U.S. without having to reduce their margins in the Euro.

\- who have most of their production in Europe but sell largely in the U.S. or otherwise using the dollar as their currency.

\- whose supply of raw materials is done in local currency but who sell primarily in dollars

These are just a few ideas of what might be the characteristics to look for. Obviously, just because a company has these attributes does not mean that it might actually be a good investment, however I feel it might be worth trying to make a list of companies that meet these requirements.

I would be willing and able to dedicate six to eight hours per day studying and practicing day trading, in hopes of eventually becoming profitable. The goal would be to make enough year after year to live comfortably on my own and afford any expenses. 

I know the odds of being profitable long term from day trading are low, but I'm pretty sure the odds are a lot better then a purely creative pursuit like being an author, which would be my dream occupation. Same when you compare it to something like being an actor or singer. The chances of those are likely less then one percent whereas it seems the chances of being a successful day trader are more like five to ten percent if you're willing to fully dedicate yourself to it. If I can prove that I'm profitable long term I have access to at least $100,000 to trade with and as far as I'm aware there aren't any account minimums in Canada.  

Writing is something I could do for a few hours every evening and probably still make a go at it, but from the research I've done day trading works a lot better if you're fully committed. If I don't go the trading route then my plan is to go back to school for something IT related as I enjoy tech and problem solving. I would still much rather be a day trader though as I can set my own hours, not have a boss, and learn at my own pace. With everything said how viable is a career as a day trader and is it something I should try and pursue?

TL;DR - I have the ability to dedicate myself fulltime to learning day trading I'm wondering if it's a viable career.

Even though the odds are low they seem a lot better then a purely creative pursuit like writing, acting, or singing.

A more than 5000% higher price was required to get Belgium to jack up deteriorating power plants to send electricity across the English Channel. 

Here's an excerpt from a piece by Javier Blas describing the issue in more detail. 

""On most days, the bottlenecks mean distorted costs. Sometimes, it  results in sky-high prices where energy is in short supply when it is  needed. At other occasions, prices can tumble to zero, or go negative,  when producers cannot sell their power into a congested transmission  system. Increasingly, it puts the whole system at risk. Talk to most  industry executives and you quickly get the sense that we  are sleepwalking into more blackouts. Discuss the problems with the  engineers who manage the system day-in, day-out, and that danger appears  even closer.    


The £9,724.54 price, settled between noon and  1:00 p.m. on July 20 via the so-called NEMO interconnector that links  the UK with Belgium, was the highest Britain has ever paid to import  electricity, nearly five times higher than the previous record. The  absurdity of that level is apparent when comparing it with the  year-to-date average for UK spot electricity: £178 per megawatt hour."" -[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-25/london-s-record-9-724-54-per-megawatt-hour-to-avoid-a-blackout?srnd=premium-uk](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-07-25/london-s-record-9-724-54-per-megawatt-hour-to-avoid-a-blackout?srnd=premium-uk)

There wasn't a huge amount of energy purchased. Only enough to power 8 houses for a year. But the purchase adds some clarity to the desperate situation unfolding in Europe. The electricity demand for households goes up during the Winter as people run heaters, light their homes during shorter days, and tend to stay inside more often. The heat wave in Europe is unprecedented. July 19th, 2022 was Europe's hottest day in history at 40.3C (104.5F,) so these are far from normal circumstances. But with Nord Stream 1 operating at 20% of it's capacity, and the recent news of further turbine hold-ups, the European gas outlook is dictated by someone who doesn't like them. Germany may need to start rationing gas to be able to build up storage for the Winter. When Freeport resumes partial plant operation in October, I believe nat gas will get a huge bump as US producers become able to take advantage of the price differences.

First a bit of background: This work was done solely by me over this weekend. I'm not a professional, nor have I attempted anything similar in the past. In fact, I wasn't aware of R squared before this weekend - so take everything with a major heap of sale. If there's mistakes and such, please feel free to point them out. It's also possible that everything I did was wrong and this is just gibberish. The point of this was to create an exercise for myself as well as create discussion online regarding attractive market options. There could also be a lot of simple mistakes there, but due to time constrains (weekend is finishing) I'm forced to post it online now. If you guys like it and if this even makes sense, I might do something similar in the future again

Also, I will happily share the Excel with the raw data and analysis. However, I do not know how to. I do not want to share from my personal office online account as I want to keep my reddit profile at least semi-private. If someone can please help me out, I would very much appreciate it. I'm sure my data and analysis needs a lot more work and we can make a editable version where multiple people can contribute

Data: Was compiled using freely available MSCI data found online. Historical PE by country MSCI Index was sourced from [Barclays](https://indices.barclays/IM/21/en/indices/static/historic-cape.app)

(data available for download). Then I found corresponding index historical data (took me a lot of time to find I might add) through [MSCI End of Day Index Data Search](https://www.msci.com/end-of-day-data-search). The website is very slow, but it works. For most of the developed markets, the data goes back to 1982, which I thought was sufficient enough to come to reasonable conclusions

Methodology: Using the data obtained above, I calculated 10 year annualized average return for each month (for example Jan 1982 to Jan 1992, Feb 1982 to Feb 1982) for each of the 12 MSCI Indexes: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, UK and USA. Then I used graph on Excel to make the line of best fit through regression analysis for each one of those markets. Because I was using 10 year returns, I could only use the 10 year annualized returns until June 2012 and run Regression analysis on CAPE vs returns until 2012 only as well. For developing countries, like Brazil and India the data set was much more limited, therefore I was forced to use 5 year returns. I also calculated the average 10 year return as well as the standard deviation for the 10 year returns. Then I ran a regression analysis on each of the data sets.

Results:

&amp;#x200B;

|Country|Current CAPE|Avrg Historical Cape|Average 10 YR Return|StDev of 10YR Return|Expected Future 10 Year Return|Line of Best Fit|R2 Squared|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|Germany|16.67|22.87|6.43%|4.86%|8.59%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1376|0.37|
|Hong Kong|16.62|20.15|8.29%|7.02%|10.32%|y = -0.0051x + 0.188|0.13|
|India|28.19|11.54|7.68%|12.22%|4.27%|y = -0.0054x + 0.1949|0.26|
|Japan|20.24|42.29|2.31%|6.40%|6.69%|y = -0.0016x + 0.0993|0.23|
|Netherlands|28|19.86|7.53%|5.97%|1.32%|y = -0.0058x + 0.1782|0.56|
|Singapore|13.12|22.20|4.94%|5.20%|8.37%|y = -0.0031x + 0.1244|0.13|
|UK|16.67|17.54|4.68%|5.24%|5.57%|y = -0.006x + 0.1557|0.25|
|USA|28.51|24.31|8.29%|5.04%|5.46%|y = -0.0052x + 0.2029|0.76|

 

Note: India and Brazil were calculated on a basis of 5 year annualized return due to the lack of data. Unlike other indexes that start in 1982, Brazil index data starts in May 2011 (earliest CAPE available) and India in August 2003.

Analysis: The data was surprising to say the least. My inspiration came from the book ""A random walk down wallstreet"" where the author Markiel mentions that CAPE Ratio, and that it is the best predictor of future returns. In the book, I believe he mentions that about 45% of the returns in the US stock market can be explained by CAPE Ratio. If my understanding is correct, he must be referencing the R squared. I do not remember which data set he used, but I wasn't able to get similar results.

Australia: Seems right around historical averages. Nothing too noteworthy, expect maybe a strong correlation (R2)

Brazil: It is the only country with expected negative returns. Brazil data sat was also the most limited, therefore it is hard to make any significant conclusions based on available data. Brazil also has the highest standard deviation. It seems that the Brazilian market has been insanely volatile in the 21st century. I did not run a Regression Analysis because I thought it was moot

Canada: Now this tripped me up big time. In fact, the only reason why I included line of best fit formula was for Canada. Canada has **POSITIVE** relationship on Cape vs Expected returns. The higher the CAPE, the higher is the 10 year expected return. I double checked the numbers. Unless I'm making a mistake somewhere that I'm not aware of, Canada is a fluke.

Europe: Nothing noteworthy with Europe MSCI Index,

Germany: Probably the best/safest investment out of all based on this analysis. German MSCI index seems to be below historical averages, has a pretty strong R2 and is posed for solid growth in the next decade from now

Hong Kong: For those wanting to take a risk, this might be a very good opportunity. I'm not at all surprised by this data, and it makes sense on an intuitive level as well. In the 2000s USA went through strong economic growth, but the stock market languished. After 2009 it went on an incredible bull run ending only now. China has spent the 2010s positioning itself from factory of the world to a world-wide brand. Tencent and other companies are now a household name. I took a short glance at the Hang Sek 50 index, and a lot of the top stocks are also Value companies. After tencent, there's a list of 4-5 banks. I checked their revenues and profits online and they have all grown massively in the last decade. Meanwhile the stock market has not moved. Of course banks are generally low P/E but it seems like the Chinese companies are highly undervalued even accounting for that. That being said, any investor should be careful to due high interference of the CCP. As for myself, I would consider buying a small leveraged position, something like Yinn 3x leveraged China ETF. However I will need to research more

India: India went through a massive bull run in the 2010s, along with USA. It is only the cyclical nature of the markets that the best performers of the previous decade tend to be lackluster in the next one. I'm not very bullish on India, especially with the sky high valuations

Japan: Japan is just a mess. Their CAPE systematically reached 50s 60s 70s and even peaked at 80s in the 2000s, they were overvalued for a long time even after the asset bubble burst. They seem like they're undervalued now, but honestly I don't think I know enough to say anything meaningful about Japan. If I were to speak out of my ass, I would say they were insanely overvalued from the 1980s all the way to 2010s so CAPE at 20 is not undervalued, but valuations catching up with reality. I would personally steer clear.

Netherlands: Interesting to see that Netherlands is overvalued next to its European peers. I do not know the reason for it. Needs more researching

Singapore: Another very good bet for the future IMO. Yes, R2 is low, but it is a developed economy and they have traditionally been very business savvy. I would definitely look more into investing into Singaporean Markets

UK: Have to say, quite surprised by this one. FTSE 100 hasn't returned much at all since the year 2000. I thought it would mean they're undervalued. but doesn't seem so. Interesting to note that while FTSE 100 (big-cap) stagnated, FTSE 250 (mid-cap) brought in stellar results, tripling since 2000. Definitely warrants further investing. I've also seen some evidence online that only FTSE 100 specifically is undervalued, so maybe a big cap play in the UK?

USA: Well, I think the amazing bull run is dead. For stellar growth in the coming years, we will have to go down much lower in the near future. Some people say it will happen, others think we're close to the bottom. If it's the latter, I personally wouldn't expect the returns of the last decade and a half going forward. In 2008/9 MSCI CAPE bottomed at 13. We're more than double that now. American markets can't grow exponentially to the corporate profit growth rate anymore without detaching from reality, so something has to give. Either we see a crash and another bull cycle, or a slow upwards growth.

Interestingly enough, USA has the highest R2. I wonder if it's due to highest pricing efficiency due to the largest investor participation.

Criticisms:

The obvious criticism of Shiller CAPE is Excess Cape. We are in an era of record low interest rates even with the recent hikes. A lot of people will rightfully point out that comparing current values to historical values is at least not painting the full picture i.e. more expensive stocks now make more sense than they did in the 90s. However Shiller CAPE is still one of the most powerful tools at our disposal for predicting future growth

The other criticism is the limitation of data. I couldn't get any meaningful information about emerging markets. Even for the developed markets, looking 1982-2012 might be too limited."|0.91|182.0|0.0|182.0|"['Squared|', 'Singaporean Markets', 'Value', 'CCP', 'Shiller', 'FTSE']"

Impact investing, by contrast, seeks to actively achieve positive external outcomes - alongside the traditional objective of ensuring an adequate financial return.

During periods of high inflation, the purchasing power of a given amount of money falls. Ergo, those who own cash lose money while those who hold real assets are normally unaffected. Noteworthy is people are still buying bonds whose expected returns is lower than inflation, because holding these bonds is still better than holding cash. This extends to all paper assets, so if you hold stocks like a hedge fund you may still have a net loss even if you make money this year, but a landlord will likely be less affected as he still collects the rent even if he must raise prices and/or put expansions on hold. Farmers and dealers of staple necessities like water and medicine will be totally unaffected as the population needs a fixed amount of the stuff and will pay any price needed.

Also recall that many people, like me, have a negative net worth due to a lot of long term debt. These people are beneficiaries of inflation as the value of their debts outstanding falls, so don't let the economy deter you from going to college and such. On the reverse side, the people who issued all this long term debt (mostly banks of all shapes and sizes) will be incurring a loss as inflation exceeds the expected return of the loans. Retirees with large nest eggs saved up will be incurring losses as the value of their fortunes fall.

And yes, the Feds are deleting all that money they printed. They are doing so with bond trading. During Covid they printed money cheaply by simply placing orders for corporate bonds on the internet using money they simply credited their accounts. Now some of those bonds are maturing and the money paid back to the Feds, and they have raised the Federal Funds Rates (the interest rates they both lend and borrow at). This had the immediate effect of increasing the amount of people lending the Feds money and decreasing the amount of people borrowing from the Feds.

I have a few focused questions and then I will give my opinion on them for everyone to tell me how ignorant I am lol. I honestly would just like some clarity or even a link to something that is fairly non biased fact based regarding the subject.

1. Why do companies buy back stock?

2. Do these companies dump this stock they buy?

3. Does future possible movement by the FED come into play as far price or even their exposure to their holding %?

4. Do companies prey on workers with options as a cheap way to increase their holding % at a discounted rate normally?

*Are buy backs positive or negative? This is kind of subjective but nonetheless *


1. I think buy backs are in place to secure their market share, temporarily support price, and to show confidence to the market.

2. I want to think they don’t dump onto new investors, bc that seems like it would be counterproductive long term. In my head though I always envision corporate greed and would have to say Yes they dump them.

3. This is one that originally made me post this. Personally I can seem them being a position that was taken on xx date, but as inflation and the fed move in the buy backs become more of a lifeline for the value of stock instead of an asset to create gains from.

4. I think yes they prey on workers.

5. I think short term they are negative but if held and used as a hedge could become a huge positive.

 July 22 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc [**(TWTR.N)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TWTR.N) on Friday blamed its ongoing battle to close its $44-billion acquisition by Elon Musk and a weakening digital advertising market for a surprise fall in quarterly revenue and a net loss. The results come as Twitter has sued Musk for dropping his offer to buy the company, and is now preparing for a legal showdown in a trial set to begin in October. The deal uncertainty has worried Twitter's advertisers and caused chaos inside the company. Advertising revenue rose just 2% to $1.08 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $1.22 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Total second-quarter revenue, which also includes revenue from subscriptions, was $1.18 billion, compared with $1.19 billion a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $1.32 billion. ""Twitter is now in the unenviable position of convincing advertisers that its ad business is solid regardless of how its court battle with Musk ends, and its Q2 earnings show that the platform has its work cut it out for it to do that,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Insider Intelligence."|0.94|1046.0|0.0|1046.0|['Reuters', 'Refinitiv IBES', 'Insider Intelligence']

t3_w4wvcv|1658450992.0|investing|The Economic Consequences of Jerome Powell|"(National Review) -- Due to his data-driven monetary-policy approach, the Fed chairman's 'soft landing' is looking less likely.

Jerome Powell  risks going down in history as the Federal Reserve’s worst chairman  since Arthur Burns, who brought us runaway inflation in the 1970s.

He risks doing so by first having kept monetary policy too loose for  too long as he waited for clear signs of inflation to actually show up  in the data. He thereby lost control over inflation and added to an  asset-price bubble. He now risks allowing the same data-driven approach  to cause him to slam on the monetary-policy brakes too hard to regain  control over inflation even at the likely cost of a deep recession.

Last year, the Fed clung to the belief that the inflation we were  experiencing was a transitory phenomenon. It did so despite early  indications that the combination of the largest peacetime budget  stimulus on record and an ultra-loose monetary policy would soon lead to  economic overheating. Instead, the Fed insisted that, before it  considered normalizing its monetary-policy stance, it would await data  showing that inflation expectations were becoming unanchored.

These views led the Fed to keep interest rates at their zero lower  bound and continue buying $120 billion a month in Treasury bonds as well  as mortgage-backed securities through most of last year. The net result  was that inflation surged to a multi-decade high while bubbles formed  in the equity, housing, and credit markets. Equity valuation reached  highs experienced only once before in the last hundred years while  housing prices increased to levels above those in 2006 even in  inflation-adjusted terms.

Fast-forward to today, we find that the Fed is making the same  mistake that it made last year but in reverse. Now with each higher  inflation print, the Fed is accelerating the pace of its monetary-policy  tightening. It is doing so without waiting to see the results of its  earlier monetary-policy actions.

This approach is inducing the Fed to now raise interest rates in  75-basis-point steps rather than by the more normal 25 basis points,  even though there are clear signs that the economy is on the cusp of a  recession and that inflationary pressures are abating, as indicated by  the sharp drop in international commodity prices. It is also inducing  the Fed to remain committed to withdrawing $95 billion a month in market  liquidity through quantitative tightening, even though equity and bond  markets are wavering.

Among the indications that the economy is already slowing are the  Atlanta Fed’s estimates that this past quarter the economy might have  contracted for a second quarter in a row. Other indications of slowing  are the decline in consumer sentiment to its [lowest level on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-10/us-consumer-sentiment-slumps-to-record-low-on-inflation-woes?sref=KgEBWdKh)  because of high inflation, the crumbling in housing demand as a result  of higher mortgage rates, and the loss of export competitiveness on  account of a strong dollar.

As if a weakening economy were not reason enough for the Fed to  exercise caution in slamming on the monetary-policy brakes,  international commodity prices are declining sharply across the board.  They are doing so in anticipation of a weakening global economy. Over  the past two months, international oil, copper, lumber, and wheat prices  have all declined by over 20 percent. This very likely means that U.S.  consumer-price inflation has already peaked.

If aggressively raising interest rates at a time when the economy is  on the cusp of a recession makes little sense, withdrawing large amounts  of liquidity at a time when the equity- and credit-market bubbles are  bursting makes even less sense. Since the start of the year, not only  have the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 lost around 30 percent and 20 percent in  value, respectively, but the bond market, too, has lost around 20  percent while the cryptocurrency markets have lost some 70 percent.

The steep decline in financial-market prices is bound to have a  meaningfully negative impact on the economic outlook. It will do so by  having wiped out over the past six months an estimated combined $15  trillion in household financial wealth. Feeling poorer, households must  be expected to cut back their spending in an effort to rebuild their  depleted savings.

All of this makes it all too likely that history will not treat  Jerome Powell kindly. First, he brought us multi-decade-high inflation.  Now he seems to be going out of his way to ensure that the economy has a  hard landing.

t3_w4wb5k|1658449389.0|investing|UPDATE: It seems that the market is finally beginning to realize that Citi is ridiculously underpriced|"On June 23rd, 2022, I submitted a post on here titled ""How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?"":

[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vjbd4l/how\_on\_earth\_is\_citis\_stock\_price\_so\_low/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vjbd4l/how_on_earth_is_citis_stock_price_so_low/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I strongly recommend reading through what I wrote and also some of the comments. I basically made a case for buying Citi since it seemed ridiculously underpriced. I backed my predictions with DCF analysis and such.

Anyways, I'm posting this because it seems that many of my predications have since come to fruition. For some reason, many believed that Citi's Q2 financials would be underwhelming due to inflation and such. Therefore, in the weeks before Citi released their Q2 financials, Citi's stock price fell to prices as low as $43/share. However, as I pointed out in my original post, rising interest rates are **good** for banks like Citi. Then on July 15th, 2022, Citi released their Q2 financials and the stock price has since soared from $43/share to prices currently around $52/share. Citi's Q2 performance wildly exceeded expectations, largely due to rising interest rates being profitable for them.

I apologize if this comes off as conceited. I don't mean to brag.

However, even with this sudden spike in price, it still seems a bit undervalued. In my original post, using DCF Analysis, I arrived at an ""intrinsic value""/intrinsic share price of $254.68/share. Not only that, but even in my ""worst-case scenario"" future free cash flow projections, I still arrived at an ""intrinsic value"" of $56.55/share. Both of these values are higher than the current share price.

However, as many comments in the original thread pointed out, it's probably not a good idea to use DCF analysis to value banks. Many suggested using the dividend discount model (DDM) instead. Using the DDM model, I came up with an intrinsic value of $70.16/share, which is far closer to the actual price. But that still means that the stock is still moderately undervalued.

Many in that thread also suggested other methods to calculate an intrinsic value such as P/E and P/B. Seeking Alpha multiplied consensus analyst estimates for FY22 by the average valuation multiples for P/E, P/B, and P/TBV of Citi and its peers, and calculated a price target of $81.13/share. This can be found in the Seeking Alpha article titled ""Citigroup Q2 Earnings: Outperforming Peers And Expectations""

They also seem to agree that the stock is still undervalued.

However, there are some reasons why Citi might not be a good buy. This year, Citi decided to freeze its dividend hikes to build its capital buffers. This stagnating dividend may deter investors from this stock despite their financials improving. However, its dividend yield is still at 3.92%, making it one of the highest in the industry. But this dividend freeze is due to a relatively poor Stress Test results, with Citi displaying lackluster capital buffers. This is a reason to think more carefully before deciding whether to go all in on Citi. But that seems like a minor issue in the grand scheme of things.

Warren Buffett recently invested an **enormous** amount of money into Citi. His ""stamp of approval"" bodes well for the future of this stock.

Overall, Citi is still a good buy. It would be very surprising if its price does not increase to $80+ in the near future. What do you guys think?

Hello! :)

i want to put aside a portion of my portfolio für some time (months). i live in germany and i don't trust the euro. i need something else

i thought about this a bit and tried to narrow my ideas down a little bit in terms of what my goal is regarding the financial instruments. 

they should be
-independent from only one currency

-low volatilit

-low correlation

-profits equal or bigger than the prime rate pf the countries central banks

i have some ideas and prediction which influence inflation in euro will stay ~5% over the next 5-7 years. the dollar has momentarily higher inföation but fed will rise interest rates and it will be under control in the next 5-7 years (lower then euro)

my conclusion

-don't buy stocks (to volatile)
-leveraged bonds (mostly government bonds) in all world currencies (usd/eur/yen)
-no inflation index bonfs (because current inflation will decrease over time)
-gold (not that volatile and low correlation)
-derivates to hedge against bond prive volatility


does my plan makes sense and is it understandable? what are your iseas? i need tips which instruments can achieve my plan. i'd like something like

-leveraged 10yr treasury notes etf + hedge
-leveraged swiss government etf not hedge , i think it will stay strong 
-gold with otm put options, heding 1/2 of my gold position against drawdowns

is my concept inherintly logical? do you have maybe ideas which instruments (isin) i can use?"|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0|['fed']

* Mortgage demand fell last week, hitting the lowest point since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

* Buyers have lost considerable purchasing power as rates have almost doubled since earlier this year.



The pain in the mortgage market is only getting worse as higher interest rates and inflation hammer American consumers.

Mortgage demand fell more than 6% last week compared with the previous week, hitting the lowest level since 2000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 7% for the week and were 19% lower than the same week in 2021. Buyers have been contending with high prices all year, but with rates almost double what they were in January, they’ve lost considerable purchasing power.

“Purchase activity declined for both conventional and government loans as the weakening economic outlook, high inflation and persistent affordability challenges are impacting buyer demand,” said Joel Kan, an economist for the MBA.

While buyers are less affected by weekly moves in interest rates, the broader picture of rising rates has already taken its toll. Mortgage rates moved higher again last week after falling slightly over the past three weeks.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 5.82% from 5.74%, with points increasing to 0.65 from 0.59 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was 3.11% the same week one year ago.

Demand for refinances, which are highly rate sensitive, fell 4% for the week and were 80% lower than the same week last year. Those applications are also at a 22-year low, but the drop in demand from homebuyers caused the refinance share of mortgage activity to increase to 31.4% of total applications from 30.8% the previous week.

Mortgage interest rates haven’t moved much this week, but that could change very soon due to increasing bond market volatility. The Federal Reserve is expected to hike rates by another 75 basis points next week, and other central banks are taking similar action against inflation. A basis point equals 0.01%.

“This is especially true next week as markets digest the newest Fed policy announcement next Wednesday, but Thursday’s policy announcement from the European Central Bank could also cause enough of a stir to impact U.S. rates,” noted Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily.

The article says inland logistics problems are being exploited by dominant ocean carriers, who own the shipping containers, through detention (failure to return shipping containers) and demurrage (port storage from failure to pick up shipping containers) fees.  The carriers are blaming the importers (using the port as extra storage space since their warehouses are full) and trucking companies (shortage of drivers).  The marine ports themselves are partly to blame (e.g. containers can only be picked up or returned by appointment and a container can only be returned if they pick up another due to lack of space).  The containers can't be picked up until all fees are paid and after any customs inspections.  Congress approved a bill to give the Federal Maritime Commission more power over the shipping industry, and the commission has handed out some fines, but they're small compared to the industry's profits.

It seems like a real big mess but how accurate is the article?  Are the carriers mostly at fault here or is it everybody?

I went to the 3 free seminar, and during that time learning a few new things I didnt know about before mainly slippage that occurs between your broker - middleman- institution.  There was some other stuff, but that was interesting to learn about.  

They have their trading platform called Clik, and they are not a brokerage firm. 

I did sign up for a 3 day training seminar, cost 100 dollars, but you get back a 50 dollar gas card.. so my cost really is 50 dollars for a 3 day , 9 to 5 classroom,  using Clik, but also learning about trading stocks, options, futures, forex, and they added in a free crypto currency class, if you signed up before end of this month. 

ya ya its all marketing and some place making money, sure I know.   But for 50 dollars, to enhance knowledge and learning hands on, in person is more my style.  Of course there is a caveat , to go through the extended academy, it costs a whole lot more, like 8500 dollars for the one part, and over 20,000 dollars for the other part..  

 Let me say this right away, I am not, I repeat, I am not going to pay that kind of money.  But I will take full advantage of 3 full days of training and learning for 50 dollars.. that is worth it to me.

Mainly my question is, has any one heard of them, what do they think besides the negative stuff I listed..

(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal

Elon Musk has accused Twitter of an “unjustifiable request to rush” the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.

Musk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.

Lawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter’s lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network — one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal — was “fundamental” to the case and required lengthier investigation and “substantial time for discovery”.

Musk’s lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a “breakneck schedule”.

“Twitter’s sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,” the filing read.

A hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.

The social media company’s lawsuit accused Musk, the world’s richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.

In a case that has captivated the corporate world, Musk’s defence rests on his ability to convince the court that the issue of bots — automated spam accounts — on the platform is far greater than previously disclosed, representing a “material adverse effect” that would give him the ability to back out of the deal.

Musk has alleged Twitter had breached the merger agreement by not sharing sufficient information on fake accounts, a position reiterated in Friday’s filing, which again questioned the company’s long-stated estimate that bots made up less than 5 per cent of users.

Following a meeting between Musk and Twitter’s chief executive Parag Agrawal, “Musk was stunned to discover that Twitter’s process for identifying spam accounts relied on human reviewers to eyeball a minuscule portion of the userbase rather than utilising the company’s machine learning capabilities”, the filing said.

In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Musk had been well aware of the site’s issue with bots, pointing to tweets posted by Musk highlighting the matter prior to the deal.

The social network also accused Musk of breaching the terms of the merger agreement that demanded he not disparage the company, by highlighting his tweets that appeared to be goading Twitter’s leadership.

Addressing that claim, Musk’s filing accused Twitter of being unable to take a joke.

“With the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji,” the filing stated. “Twitter ignores that Musk is its second-largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.”

I’m talking about long term investing with monthly dollar cost average tracking a large index like S&amp;P 500. 

From what I know, comparing both Index Fund ETFs vs Index Funds:
- Most companies don’t have minimum initial investment for index funds, this means I can start off with $10 investing in index funds. ETF can be bought fractionally which also means I can start investing with $10 so there isn’t a difference here. 
- Expense ratio seems to be almost the same/negligible (0.01% difference). If a company has their ETF’s expense ratio cheaper than their index funds, chances are I can find a competitor company with index funds’s expense ratio being similar or cheaper if I really cared about that 0.01% difference. 
- Investing for the long term means I don’t bother too much about timing the market within the day, I just invest the same amount every month till I retire. 
- A lot of these new fintech companies allow automatic withdrawal from my back account even if I’m investing in ETFs; otherwise, spending 5 minutes a month transferring money is no big deal.

&gt; The tax treatment of the sale of US partnerships can be extremely complicated for a non-US investor.  All of any capital gain, or only a part of it, may be subject to US tax on sale, depending on various factors which are broadly intended to limit the taxable gain to the extent of the partnership’s business operations in the US.

&gt; The partnership is required to withhold US tax both in respect of annual income and also when the non-US investor sells their shares.  In addition the non-US investor is required to file an income tax return to report the annual income, and again when the shares are sold.

t3_w02pig|1657929049.0|investing|Compound interest if SP500|"Hello, this seems so simple, but I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around a concept as it relates to compounding interest and investing in the SP500.


With compounding interest, given an annual compound rate of ~9%, it seems that an investment of $10K 30 years ago would be worth $132,677.

However, if I were to invest $10K using SPY for my historical return, over the last ~30 years, that investment would be worth around $77,000.

I know one’s hypothetical and one’s based on history, but I can’t seem to pinpoint the disconnect.

And to add some more info, the reason I’m wondering is because I’ve been looking at what an investment today into the SP500 would be worth in 45 years. Considering an annual return of 8-10% the growth seems insane over that time. However, when I look at the historical return of SP500 funds and what my return would be over that same timeframe it’s not even close.

I definitely never knew where the actual dividend payment per share comes from but it makes sense now. For those that aren't aware, you can look at 'Historical Data' of a security and see Open, High, Low, Close and 'Adjusted Close'. Look through the data until you find a dividend, and you'll see that dividend payments just come from the price of the stock. If the security is worth $50, and the dividend is worth $1/share, the adjusted close for that evening will be $49. It's value that we already hold that is being distributed back into our pockets as a check.

So with that said and learning more about dividends, are they actually beneficial to investors? Do they actually lead to more wealth growth?

t3_vzfywx|1657860385.0|investing|Mega Backdoor Roth Rollover Question|"I know each 401k plan is different, but do there exist plans where the following is possible: 

- I contribute after-tax dollars into 401k
- After-tax dollars are automatically converted to the Roth bucket of 401k (""in plan conversion"")
- I rollover the after-tax dollars now in the Roth bucket, to a Roth IRA (while still being employed at the same place) [???]

I am unsure if the third step above is possible? The advantage would be that I could withdraw my contributions from the Roth IRA whenever, whereas withdrawing contributions from the Roth 401k seems tricky.

Reflections
- The best place to get your 401k questions answered is your 401k provider (Fidelity, in my case). There was almost no wait-time for calling Fidelity. 
- There is a chance you may run into consultants over the phone who aren't super knowledgeable (maybe they're just starting out etc). In this case, just call again; eventually you'll run into a consultant who really knows what they're doing and can support you adequately
- The ""401k Summary Plan Description"" document contains most, but not all, the information you need about your 401k plan
- In my Summary Plan Description document, there is no explicit language to the effect of ""in service withdrawal/distribution"". However, it seems like my plan still offers this feature. Again, call Fidelity/your provider when in doubt

Conclusions (pertaining to my specific 401k plan - yours may be different)
- It is possible to rollover voluntary after-tax 401k contributions directly to a Roth IRA. However, it is not possible to automate this process (regardless of what 401k plan you're on). I will necessarily have to call Fidelity every other week (after I receive my paycheck), to request transfer of after-tax contributions to Roth IRA
- Roth 401k != Roth IRA. If I wish to have tax-free Roth growth of my investments, and I want access to my contributions penalty-free, I need to ensure that my after-tax contributions get to my Roth IRA. This is because when you withdraw from a Roth 401k, it is not possible to specify that I want to withdraw exclusively from my contributions (unlike with a Roth IRA). Necessarily, the Roth 401k withdrawal will involve a combination of contribution + earnings. The earnings will therefore be subject to the early-withdrawal penalty + tax. 
- I can always, as proposed in the initial scenario of this post, do the following: after-tax &gt; Roth 401k &gt; Roth IRA.
- Note that the in service Roth 401k &gt; Roth IRA rollover is *only* possible for the after-tax funded portion of my Roth 401k. That is, I cannot rollover paycheck Roth 401k contributions to Roth IRA.

So I'm having some trouble understanding why IPOs become oversubscribed. I get that it happens when the demand for shares is higher than the number of shares initially being sold in the IPO, which leaves investors with only a fraction of what they asked for while others will be left with nothing.

How do people get left with a fraction or even nothing? When it reaches the IPO date and the new shares go public, is it not a first come first serve process that happens in real-time? How does it become so swamped that others either get pushed out for less or completely to the side with nothing at all?

So full disclaimer, I have zero knowledge of this company or Switzerland banking or Switzerland at all. But from just looking at the chart, the stock is at all time lows. The price is currently lower than it has ever been in 10 years by about double ($10). Even during Covid, the shares were higher, at $6.80 at the depths of it all.


Why is the stock down?

Basically it boils down to lack of confidence and lack of leadership after the bank suffered two big losses, Greensil and Archageos. Greensil was a SoftBank backed venture that provides financing for companies while they wait for vendors to pay their bills. Typically businesses pay invoices within 90 days of the purchase. This can be tough when you need the money to continue operations. Anyway, Greensil lost its insurance and all the sudden, the entire model which was essentially risk free, became risky and everything was halted and without cash flow, Greensil and the companies relying on it end up stuck. CS had urged their clients to provide capital to Greensil… You see where this is heading. People lost money. 

Archegeos Capital features brave trader Bill Hwang who was able to convince banks and institutions all over the world to provide him with insane amounts of credit and leverage. Problem is no one knew just how much risk he had taken on. Turns out, it was closer to $125b. Credit Suisse suffered over a $5b loss when this venture imploded, the most of all lending parties involved by at least double. 



So what’s the play here?

Remember 2016-2019, all the losses and bad press about Deutsche Bank (DB)? DB at its lowest in 10 years which was during the Covid crash was $4.99 per share. The stock rebounded to $15 about a year later, and now sits at $7.67. Credit Suisse is the new Deutsche Bank. 

Also Switzerland has basically two premiere banks, UBS and CS. My entire thesis is centered on this continuing. One side gains and losses power/momentum but eventual the pendulum reverses. Recession or not, Credit Suisse is not going bankrupt, so the natural assumption turns to price and that the stock will return to $7-10, if not $15. My best guess is within the next few months for the first, and maybe a year or two before we see $10-15. 

The stock will be dead money for a few months. But the upside is clearly there. At $5 it’s a dirt cheap bet, even cheaper on margin ($1.15 per share, 100 share lot) if you have conviction. You can also buy 2024 10c options for $0.20 or atm calls for $1.25."|0.32|0.0|0.0|0.0|['UBS', 'CS', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Credit Suisse', 'SoftBank', 'Ticker Symbol: CS']

2022 has definitely started out that way sure.  Bonds have provided little protection during a time of high inflation and rising interest rates.

Lawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world’s richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.

Unlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.

The Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk’s Tesla Inc..

Musk and his lawyers didn’t immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter’s schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: “Oh the irony lol.”

A judge hasn’t yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter’s suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.

Twitter’s legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn’t have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.

“Litigation on the schedule Twitter proposes permits the parties and their experienced counsel ample time to assemble a trial record,” the lawyers wrote.

That would provide enough time for a judge to rule and have the Delaware Supreme Court review the ruling before the Oct. 24 closing date for the transaction, the lawyers said.

Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware finance professor and former head of the school’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, says don’t bet on it.

“I’d say a four-day trial is way more than optimistic,” Elson said Wednesday in an interview. “There’s a lot of water under the bridge on this deal and I’d say it going to take more like 10 days to try it.”

Last year, Musk traveled to Delaware for over challenge from Tesla investors to his more than $2 billion purchase of renewable-power provider SolarCity, a company he founded with his cousins. That case ate up 10 trial days. A judge ultimately concluded Musk didn’t force an overpriced SolarCity acquisition down the throats of his fellow Tesla directors.

I’m kinda confused part about the relationship of beta and returns:

&gt; In a study published in 1992, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French divided all traded stocks into deciles according to their beta measures over the 1963-1990 period. Decile 1 contained the 10 percent of stock had the lowest betas, decline 10 container the 10 of that had the highest betas. The remarkable result… there was no relationship between the return of these decile portfolios and their measures.

Isn’t stock’s beta and it’s return just a matter of definition? I.e. if $1 invested into us total stock market index in 1963 was worth $2 in 1990, and stock A cost $1 in 1963 and 1990 it cost $3 then by definition it had a beta of 2. And therefore it’s returns as well were double of the total market. So, beta 2 = 2x return. A different stock B with beta 1 would have return have half that of stock A in the same period. And there you go, a pretty linear relationship, just based on definition alone

One thought that pops into my head was the relationship is between beta “expected returns” and not beta vs “returns”. I.e. if you compare the stock beta if last 6 months vs expected returns in the next 6 months on a rolling basis, then the relationship becomes a lot more complicated. The concept of “expected returns” has already been introduced in the book tho, so I’m confused why it doesn’t specify that

Or is there something else completely that I’m missing?"|0.81|10.0|0.0|10.0|[]

The Bank of Canada today increased its target for the overnight rate to 2½%, with the Bank Rate at 2¾% and the deposit rate at 2½%. The Bank is also continuing its policy of quantitative tightening (QT).

Inflation in Canada is higher and more persistent than the Bank expected in its April Monetary Policy Report (MPR), and will likely remain around 8% in the next few months. While global factors such as the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply disruptions have been the biggest drivers, domestic price pressures from excess demand are becoming more prominent. More than half of the components that make up the CPI are now rising by more than 5%. With this broadening of price pressures, the Bank’s core measures of inflation have moved up to between 3.9% and 5.4%. Also, surveys indicate more consumers and businesses are expecting inflation to be higher for longer, raising the risk that elevated inflation becomes entrenched in price- and wage-setting. If that occurs, the economic cost of restoring price stability will be higher.

Global inflation is higher, reflecting the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, ongoing supply constraints, and strong demand. Many central banks are tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, and the resulting tighter financial conditions are moderating economic growth. In the United States, high inflation and rising interest rates are contributing to a slowdown in domestic demand. China’s economy is being held back by waves of restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Oil prices remain high and volatile. The Bank now expects global economic growth to slow to about 3½% this year and 2% in 2023 before strengthening to 3% in 2024.

Further excess demand has built up in the Canadian economy. Labour markets are tight with a record low unemployment rate, widespread labour shortages, and increasing wage pressures. With strong demand, businesses are passing on higher input and labour costs by raising prices. Consumption is robust, led by a rebound in spending on hard-to-distance services. Business investment is solid and exports are being boosted by elevated commodity prices. The Bank estimates that GDP grew by about 4% in the second quarter. Growth is expected to slow to about 2% in the third quarter as consumption growth moderates and housing market activity pulls back following unsustainable strength during the pandemic.

The Bank expects Canada’s economy to grow by 3½% in 2022, 1¾% in 2023, and 2½% in 2024. Economic activity will slow as global growth moderates and tighter monetary policy works its way through the economy. This, combined with the resolution of supply disruptions, will bring demand and supply back into balance and alleviate inflationary pressures. Global energy prices are also projected to decline. The July outlook has inflation starting to come back down later this year, easing to about 3% by the end of next year and returning to the 2% target by the end of 2024.

With the economy clearly in excess demand, inflation high and broadening, and more businesses and consumers expecting high inflation to persist for longer, the Governing Council decided to front-load the path to higher interest rates by raising the policy rate by 100 basis points today. The Governing Council continues to judge that interest rates will need to rise further, and the pace of increases will be guided by the Bank’s ongoing assessment of the economy and inflation. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy interest rate. The Governing Council is resolute in its commitment to price stability and will continue to take action as required to achieve the 2% inflation target."|0.95|208.0|0.0|208.0|['The Governing Council', 'MPR', 'Bank', 'the Governing Council', 'The Bank of Canada', 'the Bank Rate']

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The explosion in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing has led to strong reliance on ESG ratings providers—and questions about the reliability of those ratings. This is not surprising given that trillions of dollars are at stake in ESG investing. A research paper by MIT Sloan School of Management research associate [Florian Berg](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2894518048&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmitsloan.mit.edu%2Fstaff%2Fdirectory%2Fflorian-berg%3Fmsclkid%3D34479c19ab7911eca4f7c145c0f60973&amp;a=Florian+Berg) and Kornelia Fabisik and Zacharias Sautner of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, validates these concerns, as they discovered ""widespread and repeated"" changes to the historical ESG scores by a leading vendor of this data.   
&gt;  
&gt;Berg says, ""The incredible growth of sustainable finance has created a billion-dollar market for ESG data. Yet, we found that the data is not reliable or consistent. The changes made in ESG scores at any particular time in history are massive.""  
&gt;  
&gt;He explains that the data for any specific point in time should remain the same for a firm unless there is a documented reason for a retroactive change. However, their study revealed significant unannounced and unexplained changes to the data provided by [Refinitive ESG](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=2880314828&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.refinitiv.com%2Fen%2Ffinancial-data%2Fcompany-data%2Fesg-data&amp;a=Refinitive+ESG), which was previously owned by Thomson Reuters. For example, looking at two versions of the same Refinitive ESG data for identical firm years – one from September 2018 and the other from September 2020 – the median overall scores in the rewritten data were 18% lower than in the initial data.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The score rewriting leads to large changes in what are deemed to be high- or low-ESG firms. This is important because the classification of firms is widely used in ESG research and the investment industry,"" says Berg, cofounder and research associate of the [MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative's Aggregate Confusion Project](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3579819-1&amp;h=3574784543&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmitsloan.mit.edu%2Fsustainability-initiative%2Faggregate-confusion-project%3Fmsclkid%3D344913b5ab7911ec8f630780683a8302&amp;a=MIT+Sloan+Sustainability+Initiative%27s+Aggregate+Confusion+Project).  
&gt;  
&gt;In their paper, the researchers highlight how firms that performed better in a given year experienced upgrades in their E and S scores for that year through the data rewriting. Using predictive regressions, they showed that investing in firms with higher ESG scores in the initial data would not have led to economically or statistically significant performance gains. Yet, in the rewritten data, they found economically large, statistically significant positive effects of the E&amp;S score on the firm's future stock returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These large differences matter because this performance would not have been possible with the data available to investors when forming their investment strategies,"" says Berg.  
&gt;  
&gt;He notes that the data rewriting occurs on an ongoing basis without any public announcements. To show this, the researchers compared ESG scores from February 9 and March 23, 2021 – just six weeks apart – and found that 85% of firms' scores changed. While the score changes were mostly small in magnitude, the ongoing retroactive changes affected the classification of firms and the link between ESG scores and returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;Berg says, ""Our study highlights the incentive of the data provider to introduce a positive relationship between ESG scores and returns in the data to demonstrate that their ESG scores are useful for data users developing ESG-related investing strategies. Investors should always beware and conduct due diligence, but this is particularly critical with ESG ratings."""|0.92|211.0|0.0|211.0|['MIT', 'Thomson Reuters', 'Refinitive ESG', 'the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management', 'ESG', 'Florian+Berg', 'MIT Sloan School of Management']

• How do they pay a fixed return to investors during development?

For context, the fall out rate from home buying contracts hovered at a steady \~12% for three years leading up to the Pandemic. Homes are now falling out of contract 14.9% of the time for June 2022. This is not a dramatic fall-out rate yet but I think it will be interesting to keep an eye on. It seems buyers are more likely to have contingencies and are either forced to pull-out (because of higher interest rates) or not afraid to pull out of a contract.

This of course does not mean the housing market will crash but at the very least it seems we are going back to a balanced market where buyers at least have room to negotiate contingencies such as inspection.

Sean Snaith, national economist and director of UCF's Institute for Economic Forecasting, said that the country is in for a year-long recession in his latest U.S. Economic Forecast.

Snaith said that the recession may be what is needed to solve the inflation problem.   A ""pasta bowl recession,"" due to its *low and shallow* shape.  

""While the recession may not be deep, he expects it to likely last four quarters – representing the wide part of the bowl. He predicts the mild slowdown should help the Federal Reserve bring inflation to heel while giving the global supply chain time to return to normal and allowing gas and oil prices to come down,"" a report from UCF says.

Other predictions:

Payroll job growth of 3.7% in 2022 will turn negative in 2023, fall to -0.3%, and fall further to -1.0% in 2024 before turning slightly positive at 0.6% in 2025.

Housing starts will decline from 1.6 million in 2022 to 1.4 million, then hover at this level through 2025.

11.4 million job openings will provide a shock absorber for the impact of the recession on the labor market. The headline unemployment rate is expected to rise from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% late in 2024 before beginning a gradual decline in 2025.

With more people switching to organic foods and healthy food choices like plant-based foods, the emphasis on healthy eating has followed suit. The younger generation, which is more inclined to spend more on higher-quality, healthier foods, is where this transition is most noticeable. Additionally, customers worldwide are putting more of an emphasis on health, environmental sustainability, and ethical eating practices, which has created new market niches within the food sector. Due to the millennial generation's preference for sustainability, healthy food stocks are on the rise, which has given investors a ton of new chances

By 2025, the global market for food solutions, according to Bank of America, will be worth more than $300 billion. The sector is being impacted by factors including the growth of plant-based proteins, autonomous food and grocery delivery, animal health, and organic farming. In 2020, 57 percent of US households purchased plant-based goods, according to a report by the Plant Based Foods Association. Additionally, the nation's total sales of organic and health food increased by 27% to $7 billion. According to Research and Markets, the US market for plant-based meals will expand at a CAGR of 9.69 percent through 2027.

Numerous food firms have risen to the top as a result of the increased demand for sustainable and healthy food options. For instance, the US retail sales of Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND), which went public in 2019, increased by 27% in the first quarter of 2021. Current market expansion for Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) includes China and several regions of Europe. The quarter's net sales increased 11.4 percent to $108.2 million.

By providing a broad selection of natural and organic items under the brand name Annie's, General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS), a US grocery behemoth, has made tremendous advancements in the sector. The company also owns the Cascadian Farm brand, which is one of the top sustainable and healthy food stocks to buy because it uses sustainable agricultural production methods. The hybrid model of conventional and organic food goods that General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS) uses include price points that are accessible to most consumers. Due to the rise in demand for household food items during the COVID-19 epidemic, sales in the company's organic food division increased by 7% during the quarter.

The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. is a different business that has experienced substantial growth (NASDAQ: HAIN). Given that the company's shares increased by almost 24 percent over the previous 12 months, it is one of the best-performing companies in the market for healthy foods. The demand for The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: HAIN) natural food items is increasing as more customers choose a sedentary lifestyle. The business's Yves Veggie Cuisine brand has already gained recognition by delivering cutting-edge plant-based goods without the use of flavorings or artificial additives.

PlantX ([VEGA.CN](https://VEGA.CN)) platform is the one-stop shop for everything plant-based and serves as the online face of the plant-based community. The business provides customers in North America with more than 10,000 plant-based goods in quickly expanding category verticals. The company, which is not only restricted to an e-commerce platform, now has plans in place to expand its product lines to include cosmetics, apparel, and its own water brand, in addition to providing meal and indoor plant deliveries. It provides education and, more significantly, cultivates a community of like-minded customers through its digital platform. Its thriving business is based on alliances with leading chefs, dietitians, and brands. For everyone interested in adopting a plant-based diet and enjoying a longer, better, and happier life, the company lowers entrance barriers.

People are searching for sustainable investing alternatives in greater numbers. Fortunately, there are chances to invest in businesses that consider their impact on people, animals, and the environment in addition to earnings.

 WILMINGTON, Del, July 8 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc **(TWTR.N)** has a strong legal case against Elon Musk walking away from his $44 billion deal to acquire the U.S. social media company but could opt for a renegotiation or settlement instead of a long court fight, according to legal experts.

Delaware courts, where the dispute between the two sides is set to be litigated, have set a high bar for acquirers being allowed to abandon their deals. But target companies often choose the certainty of a renegotiated deal at a lower price or financial compensation rather than a messy court battle that can last for many months, three corporate law professors interviewed by Reuters said."|0.87|1098.0|0.0|1098.0|['WILMINGTON', 'Reuters', 'https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-has-legal-edge-deal-dispute-with-musk-2022-07-09/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-has-legal-edge-deal-dispute-with-musk-2022-07-09/']

Seeking to explain this. Best theory I have come up with is that because the hedged fund uses forward contracts to hedge their currency exposure, they have to pay to a fee equivalent to the interest differential (which rate exactly?) between the 2 currencies. So if the level of interest on the Euro is significantly lower (it is, but again not sure which rate I'm referring to exactly), the fund will be taking a notable loss.

But then if that is true, it makes a mockery of the idea of using currency hedging on short duration bonds, because the positive interest differential you are trying to capture will mostly get wiped out by the negative cost of carry incurred in hedging the currency exposure.

t3_vv2ggx|1657375603.0|investing|Is Commercial Real Estate a Systemic Risk?|"Hello,

I would like to discuss the risk of a deleveraging event in the commercial real estate sector.  It seems there are a combination of headwinds that are hitting this market all at once.  Could this be the equivalent of the 2008 housing crisis?  Is residential real estate the potential systemic risk that arises from Fed policy tightening and residual impacts of COVID?

Let's just examine some of the risks facing the commercial real estate industry:

* Commercial Real Estate tends to be in high-traffic areas, meaning it commands a higher price per square foot than residential or other types of real estate
* Commercial RE is comprised of several subsectors, including Office, Retail and Hospitality
   * These subsectors are somewhat interdependent.  That is, high-traffic areas depend on office workers to support restaurants and hotels nearby.  Retail as well, to a lesser extent.
* Commercial RE tends to be financed in shorter duration than residential.  Commercial RE loans tend to average around 5 years in length.  They will often be structured differently as well, one popular format being a ""balloon structure"", where the lender pays regular payments for the duration of the loan, then a large lump sum for the remainder at maturity.
* Interest rates have been increasing rapidly and steeply to combat inflation, greatly increasing the cost of financing, especially compared to the past 2 years post-COVID.
* The work-from-home movement has displaced workers from offices, and has resulted in companies moving out of higher cost areas in favor of lower cost areas (for ex. from SF to Atlanta)
* Work-from-home is more prominent and durable in white collar office jobs, which tend to be in the most desirable areas (downtown major cities)

**Retail**

* Increasing number of retail transactions done online
* Brick &amp; mortar retail is in a long term and likely permanent downtrend
* Even the consumer staples retailers like Walmart, Target just had their worst quarter possibly ever.  Imagine how the less established players are doing.
* Now imagine how they will do if we have a long term recession

[https://www.commercialsearch.com/news/manhattan-falls-on-lowest-vacancy-list/](https://www.commercialsearch.com/news/manhattan-falls-on-lowest-vacancy-list/)

It's no question we are entering a recessionary environment.  Many companies are entering crisis mode.  Some of the most impacted industries are technology, biotech and consumer discretionary.  Raising more capital via equity is now extremely unfavorable for these companies.  Their valuations have been decimated.  Many companies have lost 80%+ (TDOC, PTON, PYPL, DOCU, RBLX, ETC ETC).

Similar decimation in the venture capital markets.  There's just very little capital being deployed at the moment.  And that is likely to continue for the near future as the Fed continues interest rate hikes and the market continues its risk-off trend.  There is low potential upside in the near-term, because any significant recovery in equities would put pressure on the Fed to tighten further.

There was too much excess capital.  It needs to be washed out.  That doesn't happen overnight.  Not from these levels.  There is little reason for excitement in the near term.  The Fed has to ensure inflation stays low, and they will require more than a few lower CPI prints to feel satisfied.

So with all that said, all forms of assets are in a pretty violent repricing at the moment.  Real estate has been more stubborn to drop, but it is already coming under pressure.  US residential real estate has less impact.  There is a supply shortage of homes.  There are lots of potential buyers on the sidelines hoping for prices to drop.  Most homeowners refinanced during the Pandemic and locked in low interest rates for 20+ years.

So even if residential drops, it should be relatively uneventful.  The residential market can absorb a correction.  Commercial is a different story.  Real estate is highly-leveraged in general.  No one comes in and buys a property for cash.  Especially in a zero interest rate environment like we had just a year ago.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG)

There's an estimated $2.6 Trillion in commercial real estate loans outstanding.  Who is going to backstop those loans in a deleveraging event?  The banks?  You think the banks are gonna come in and take those properties?  The banks are in no position to absorb a commercial real estate collapse.

This isn't 2008.  There is no ""easy"" way out of this.  You can bail out these commercial RE loans, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem.  These properties as they exist today are decreasing in utility.  Many will need to be converted into residential / other.  There is simply way too much office space, and probably way too much retail as well.

In 2008, the housing crisis was just an issue of writing too many mortgages and packaging them as high quality products.  The houses itself weren't the problem.  People still needed houses then as much as they did before, and as much as they do today.  Technology has not displaced the need for a house.  In fact, due to work-from-home, it has increased the budget for the average consumer's house.

Commercial does not have that same intrinsic necessity.  Stores have found a ton of new real estate... online.  Offices have moved... online.  All the businesses that went into supporting the traffic involved in those types of properties are at risk.  

So get ready.  This could be the ""big one"" that defines this market cycle.  If commercial starts going down the toilet, it will be a systemic risk and it will extend all across the market.  IMO it is the first thing that ""breaks"" from the Fed continuing to hike rates."|0.75|23.0|0.0|23.0|['Brick &', 'DOCU', 'Fed', 'Target', 'ETC', 'https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CREACBM027NBOG', 'PYPL', 'TDOC']

I'd also save a bit on expenses - the one I have is on the low end for similar funds, but far greater than index ETFs.

I am invested in a biotech company who’s listed on the nasdaq that’s currently around $1 per share.  They have patents and research, but monetization hasn’t happened.  This has always felt like it’s just waiting for a buyout from a larger company who can take the patents and work and commercialize/monetize it.

So my question becomes, how would a company buyout work in relation to the stock price?  I have not really found a good “this is what typically happens” stock price model.

For example, say the acquiring company agrees to buy all the outstanding stock for $5 a share?  What happens to the current stock’s value?  

Or, say the acquiring company’s stock is $100 a share.  They offer a 20-1 stock swap (basically the same $5 per share in acquiring company’s stock.)

I assume these are the two most likely scenarios, but is there another scenario that is typical?  Which one of these scenarios (or whatever else) is better or worse for me as the shareholder?

That doesn't make a lot of sense because negative interest rates won't ever compound to positive returns, so I was wondering if this has any kind of financial interpretation.

The calculation:

So, the formula for compound interest is `A = P (r/n + 1)^(tn)`

Imagine you have a total capital after investment A'. The equivalent compound interest you can calculate by doing `A' = A = P(r/n + 1)^(tn)`. Which you can calculate by filling in the data and calculating the roots where

    P(r/n + 1)^(tn) - A' = 0

To give you an example. I invest 10000€ and when I close that investment I have 11000€, say after 5 years. I want to calculate how much yearly compound every month interest is that, so I solve for r:

    10000 * (r / 12 + 1) ^ (5 * 12) - 11000 = 0

That's a degree 60 polynomial equation, so it has 60 different solutions. Most of them complex. But you can substitute for `c = 0.0190` or `c = -24.0191` to see that both give you a solution to the equation.

So apparently -2400% interest rates are equal to a 10% return in 5 years.

In a normal environment (generally), higher than expected NFPs lead a stronger dollar and stronger market because it shows a growing economy. For the dollar, this means interest rate hikes are more probable than previously priced in as well as demand for dollars. For the market, this means more people have jobs, so there's more purchasing power, so earnings will be stronger than was priced in. 

HOWEVER, today's environment is different because of inflation and stagflation fears. For the dollar it's still pretty straightforward - higher NFPs = stronger underlying economy, lower stagflation fears, and more likelihood that the Fed will be able to raise rates, so it's bullish for the dollar (and vice versa for if NFPs are lower). 

The market, however, is much more complicated. On one hand, if NFPs are higher it means that the underlying economy is stronger than priced in since consumers have more money to spend (so earnings could be higher). BUT, at the same time it means that the Fed will be able to continue hiking interest rates since the labor market is still strong (a lot of people have been talking about a Fed pause in late 2022 due to a weakening economy). This is where my confusion lies. 

In essence my question is: if NFPs are stronger than expected, which one will drive the **stock** market more: the fact that interest rates are likely to be higher for longer than priced in or the fact that the labor market and underlying economy are stronger than priced in?

Most trading platforms like Robinhood etc, have the following selling triggers:
1. Limit Order
2. Trailing Stop Order
3. Stop Order
4. Stop Limit Order

Let’s say you purchased a stock for $10 and have a target price of $15 after which you would like to sell it. However if the stock keeps going up, you would like to be in on those gains too. 
The simple Limit Order will rob you of any gains after your target has reached. 

The Trailing stop Order will set a specified % below the current price keep increasing as the stock increases. It will trigger a sell if the stock price starts a downswing and goes below the trail price. 
This allows you to get any gains during the upswing and limit your downswing losses. 

However you want to hold the stock even if it goes down and only trigger a sell if it hits your target price but only AFTER it passes your target price and then goes down a % from the maximum. 

To illustrate what I’m talking about take the example I previously mentioned. After the stock hits your target price of $15 it continues to go up to $20 and then starts going down. Let’s say we specify a trailing stop % of 10%. This means the sell will be triggered when the stock reaches $18. 
This method is effectively combining the Limit Order and TrailingStop Order.

t3_vst23n|1657122359.0|investing|US job openings slip but employment remains to be solid|"By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer

Employers posted 11.3 million job openings at the end of May, the [Labor Department said Wednesday](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf), down from nearly 11.7 million in April. Job openings reached 11.9 million in March, the highest level on records dating back more than 20 years. There are nearly two job openings for every unemployed person, a sharp reversal from the historic pattern: Before the pandemic, there were always more unemployed people than available jobs.

The figures reflect the unusual nature of the post-pandemic economy: Inflation is hammering household budgets, forcing consumers to pull back on spending, and growth is weakening, heightening fears the [economy could fall into recession](https://apnews.com/article/politics-united-states-business-layoffs-prices-f899b5d7e989fbe748c4ff49e2ed6096). Yet companies are still scrambling to add workers. Demand has been particularly strong in travel- and entertainment-related services.

“*This is not what a recession looks like,” said Nick Bunker, director of economic research at employment website Indeed's Hiring Lab. “Clouds can move in quickly and darken the outlook for the U.S. labor market, but for now, the sun is still shining.*”

Americans are also far more likely to quit their jobs than before the pandemic, mostly for new jobs at higher pay, another trend that is pushing up incomes. The number of people quitting fell to 4.3 million in May, down about 60,000 from April and below a record 4.5 million last November, but still historically high.

Economists are closely monitoring the jobs opening figures for signs the labor market is cooling, which could bring down inflation. With companies posting so many available positions, they have also been raising pay and offering more benefits to attract and keep workers. Higher labor costs have, in turn, contributed to pushing up prices, with [inflation now at 40-year highs](https://apnews.com/article/key-inflation-report-highest-level-in-four-decades-c0248c5b5705cd1523d3dab3771983b4).

The Federal Reserve has targeted the nearly record-high job openings as evidence that the economy has overheated, and [is rapidly lifting the short-term interest rate](https://apnews.com/article/fed-interest-rates-inflation-be1b698e48327d3a33847be25aba3e3d) it controls to cool consumer and business spending. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hopes that weaker spending will reduce demand for workers, lower job openings and wage increases, and bring down inflation.

For now, labor demand remains strong. Last month, the government said that [employers added 390,000 jobs in May,](https://apnews.com/article/us-economy-jobs-report-493e18e85978b9655766ef3129d8d4f8) a healthy increase, while the unemployment rate stayed at 3.6%, near a 50-year low.

There are signs that hiring and the demand for labor may cool in the coming months. On Friday, the June jobs report is expected to show that employers added 275,000 jobs, which would be a solid increase but the smallest in more than a year.  And Homebase, a company that provides payroll and hiring software for small businesses, says it has seen a 16% drop in new job postings by its customers in June compared with May. A separate survey of 400 of its clients finds that while most plan to add jobs this year, the proportion who say they won’t add jobs has doubled to 8% in June compared with January of this year. And the proportion who plan to add more than 11 workers has fallen sharply, to nearly 19%, down from 30% in January.

And a survey of executives at manufacturing firms found that last month new orders actually declined compared with May, as Americans cut back their spending on manufactured goods. Yet a separate survey Wednesday of restaurants, banks, and other companies that provide services showed growth remained solid."|0.87|83.0|0.0|83.0|['AP Economics Writer\n\nEmployers', 'May,](https://apnews.com', 'Labor Department', 'Fed', 'The Federal Reserve', 'Wednesday](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf']

Given, the initial and brief inversion in April 2022 garnered most of the attention, but I personally think this one will get a bit deeper unless the Fed immediately walks back some rhetoric. Keep in mind, the inversion in April occurred before the Fed had even started to raise interest rates. It was more or less off the back of traders selling short-dated bonds in advance of the hiking cycle, and doing so more than they ever had before. 

Typically the long dated end of the curve starts to call out the fed's bluff during a hiking cycle as growth starts to slow down, which ***may*** be what's happening right now. 

As for inevitable discussions of recession and lag time from inversions, keep in mind that statistically, there is a wide window in which markets may or may not react to an inversion. In the Dotcom bubble, there was a secondary inversion that occurred right as the tech market topped in March of 2000. Recession didn't occur until later, but for the purpose of investors trying not to lose money, the inversion essentially top-ticked markets. On the other hand, the initial GFC inversion occurred over 2 years before the 2008 meltdown.

But once the funds have been used, once the project of the company has been released.

What is the point of still having a stock? How does a company benefit from it? This sounds like long term enslavement for me.

Sure it can act as an ""incentive"" for the company to be efficient and good at what they do.
But by definition a company offering their stock no longer have stocks to sell so they cannot raise money once the IPO has ended.

And if the company happen to have stocks to sell, raising money will dump the market. But anyway after that the company won't have more stocks to sell. And if they create more stock, diluting the value of existing stocks, then dividends will not really make up for the losses, which is a fairly clunky system for everyone.

Since inception, the S&amp;P is up 4000% - the CAC is up the amount I used to round up the s&amp;p value, or a meager 200%. The DAX seems a bit better, but still nowhere close the S&amp;P. Let's not even talk about something like the eurostoxx 50.

So, as an investor, why would I ever want to invest in European indices when it seems like their performance is just... constantly bad (and why is that the case in the first place)? Sure, ""geographical exposure"" you might say, but what's the point of geographical exposure when the exposure I used to diversify (a) sucks and (b) even more or less mirrors my other exposure, just with worse performance?

TRA97 (""Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997"") and IRS Section 1259 links here for anyone unfamiliar with the concept -

It's very clear how it applies to the short sale of the same equity positions. 

TRA97 uses the term ""substantially identical property"", ""offsetting notional principal contract"", and ""an offsetting futures, or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property"".

I typically use collars and occasionally protective puts as a hedge. But I write naked puts and calls regularly. 

In the quarterly consultation with my new tax accountant, it was suggested I need to be careful about matching up naked calls with long puts on substantially identical underlying so that it can't be considered a synthetic short and violate the spirit of the rule. Since he wasn't a tax attorney, he felt that it was the safest course of action. 

I am curious so I searched around without success but I'm wondering if anyone has ever seen any IRS cases where the IRS has claimed a short against the box violation when options were used? Or even using inverse ETFs?"|0.73|8.0|0.0|8.0|['IRS', 'irs', 'publ34/PLAW-105publ34.pdf']

I am struggling to understand the connection between reported company earnings and the price of a stock.

To the best of my understanding a quarterly improvement on reported earnings for a company will theoretically rise the price of a stock, but I want to know why?

Is it simply because people will be less confident to invest in a company with falling earnings in fear that they will go bankrupt, thus lowering demand, or is it related to the estimates of economists influencing consumer sentiment?
I say this because recently poorly performing companies such as gamestop have seen huge stock price boosts, while companies reporting much more consistent and strong earnings have seen no where near that level of prosperity.

Also, 64% of all local government revenue are funded by real estate development vehicle and land lease and real estate account for over 70% of household net wealth.

t3_vqumaz|1656893301.0|investing|Thoughts on small cap value tilts?|"Since 1926, US small cap value stocks have significantly outperformed the US total market. The annual CAGR for US small cap value since 1926 is 12.5%, compared to 10.5%^(1) for the S&amp;P 500 (before inflation).

Increasingly, investors are advised to invest in a portfolio of market indexes, such as the S&amp;P 500 (US large cap blend) and total market indexes.

Some investors avoid small cap value stocks (and small cap growth stocks) due to worries about higher risks and volatility. Historically, this fear is not completely unjustified as small cap value stocks are more volatile, with a standard deviation of 18% compared to 15% in the S&amp;P 500 since 1976. However, surprisingly (while more volatile) small cap value has shown higher Sortino/Sharpe ratios than the S&amp;P 500 over the last 50 years, possibly indicating better risk-adjusted returns^(2).

A number of studies and research highlight this long term outperformance, including the well known works of Fama and French^(3).

Some questions:
* Is the higher risk nature of small cap value the reason investors avoid this tilt, instead generally having a preference large cap/total market?
* Would this meet the typical idea of ""performance-chasing""?
* If investing with a specific tilt such as small cap value is considered ""performance-chasing"" even when scientific research has shown improved returns over 100 years, why then is investing in the total market not ""performance-chasing"". People invest in the stock market because they believe it will return a long term CAGR of around 7% (because it has historically), aren't they ""chasing"" that return as it is not guaranteed and treasuries for example would return a smaller but less ""speculative"" return? Where's the boundary of ""performance-chasing""?
* Why do you believe small cap value has outperformed?
* Why shouldn't I have small cap value indexes as a main part of my long term portfolio?
* Is there a systematic problem investing in small cap value, am I missing some obvious downside?

For example, Patrick Boyle [presented](https://youtu.be/0jxoVSUSHg0) [skip to 15:30] very convincing and sourced information that shows that an investor investing money at the beginning of the interest rate cut will do much better in terms of equity returns than during interest rate hikes (in the US) and the in the UK all off the equity premium was earned during interest rate cuts only. This is very convincing information based on study looking at a 130 year period in the Uk and USA

On the other hand I’ve seen often quoted stat, as below in the link presented by day trading YouTube channel “FX Evolution” (unfortunately unsourced) that the previous [5 out of 7 times](https://youtu.be/eXuXiTdr6vM) [skip to 11:30] the Fed has cut the rates this has lead to a recession - in fact it is cutting after the hikes which is the most dangerous part. Unfortunately there’s no good source of this information, except for a video like above of articles mentioning that previous hike and cut cycles have led to bad results, however I have not across well researched articles on this. I was not able to find anything useful further online. 

Although it is not strictly contradictory - positive equity returns can happen during recessions like during Covid, I don’t think that’s the norm. And if recessions commonly happened during rate cuts there would probably not be a such a noticeable positive equity return as the market tend to fall during recessions. 

So which one of these is true? Do interest rate cuts tend to lead recessions/bear markets or economic booms/bull markets?

The remainder of the cryptocurrency project that Meta Platforms Inc.’s Founder Mark Zuckerberg took a beating over from Congress is officially shutting down. Meta’s Novi pilot—a money-transfer service using the company’s own cryptocurrency digital wallet—will end on Sept. 1, the service said on its website, a link to which it texted to its users. Both the Novi app and Novi on WhatsApp will no longer be available, the company said on the Website. Starting July 21, users will no longer be able to add money to their accounts, Novi said, advising users to withdraw their balance “as soon as possible.” Users won’t be able to access their transaction history or other data after the pilot ends. The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”

The stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

Its not its mixed and that's what the price action reflected or it would of ran over 515-525 range.

So from 1 to 1 customer to employee ratio now its more like - 10 -20 customers to 1.0001 employees (0.0001 is for IT, 1 per 1000 customer service agents). More agents mean faster orders and more orders per day. And this is what exactly reflected on q1 of earnings release, sales per day was up 18%.


 Add the amazing 1st quarter results increasing forward outlook on the year and EPS range from 23.50-25.50 to 25.00 -27.00. Everything increased from sales up 18%,  margins up 15% and outstanding shares decreased.  I've already wagered that the low is in here at 440.50 -11%.

So I have been told by many people (including a Fidelity financial advisor that we get a free consultation with as part of my job) that Roth 401k is the better path vs a traditional 401k if available, especially when younger.

That being said, I also have heard a counter argument that seems to also make sense: specifically, it is that Roth 401k contributions are not the best path because they are taxed at your top marginal rate. So as an example, if you make around $100k a year, your Roth 401k contribution is functionally taxed at a marginal rate of 24%. If you were to contribute to a traditional 401k, though, then you would not only be able to put more money into it at the present time to grow, but you would also then withdraw the money at an effective rate below that 24% top marginal rate. I also realize that Roth gains are untaxed, though, which makes this even more confusing since that might make Roth superior to Traditional.

So I guess my question in all this is if anyone has a recommendation or good rule of thumb (based on age or anything else) on when it is best to put money into a Roth vs traditional 401k?"|0.67|15.0|0.0|15.0|['Fidelity']

I'm not sure exactly what number to cherrypick from what report to get the conversation started here.

Obviously, most of us are not professional analysts, so we are pretty far from ""the best person for the job"" when it comes to giving an educated opinion on such a robust economic topic.

2021 earnings: 208.49

2022 earnings estimate: 225

2023 earnings estimate: 240

Why are S&amp;P earnings estimated to grow 8% from 2021 -&gt; 2022, and 6.66% 2022 -&gt; 2023? If markets are forward looking... why does it feel like there's still a bit of wiggle room for future earnings estimates to be adjusted downwards? Why are markets being optimistic instead of pessimistic?

I pulled up the top 100 companies of the S&amp;P by earnings TTM (not EPS, EPS * # shares outstanding). Top 100 companies make up 65% of the market cap and 73% of the earnings for the S&amp;P500

Building stock portfolios seemed a bit scary to me as I don't do this for a living and i worried somewhat about divesifying, however, the reality is you don't need 500 stocks to diverisfy - 15-20 can do it. Plus, i have a day job so i don't have time to deep dive into more than 10 or so companies (again, i don't do this for a living!).  This seemed fine to me...until I took a holistic view of what I was buying..and realized i was pretty concentrated in certain sectors or regions..which were somewhat highly correlated!  

So i switched over to ETFs and suprisingly, my performance has been better than my individual stock picks - even over short time periods.  I focus more on macro-level drivers, and less on which company within a certain sector/region/theme, etc.  

I also evaluated using a robo-advisor, but that just felt too detatched.   I want to be somewhat involved, for better or worse.  I never even considered a financial advisor - I just think their fees are way too high and I didn't love their value add or service for certain family members that had bad experiences and outcomes.  

I'm guessing there are people in both camps (ETFs vs stock pickers), but i'm cuirious - how has your experiences gone?  Its been a bit of a journey for me, but ETFs just seem better suited for someone like me who doesn't focus on stocks all day/everyday."|0.84|4.0|0.0|4.0|[]

My (very likely faulty) logic: Greece never recovered from the 2008 recession and we bailed the country out but not without repercussions. This time around the rate hikes might be too much and break the back of several, even bigger economies than that of Greece. Portugal, Spain, Italy, France and Greece are eurozone countries and all of those are not in the best shape and their GDP has not recovered from the 2008 crash. I consider them to be zombie economies, stagnating, barely able to reinvent themselves. Almost no room to grow, only down from here. This is the old world I am seeing and the threat of recession and inflation is making me doubt the health of Euro.

&gt;Tesla has held about 70 percent of the EV market share in recent years. That is forecast to drop to a mere 11 percent over the next four years, says John Murphy, the Bank of America analyst behind the annual Car Wars report that looks at the auto industry and predicts which companies are on a winning path and which are not.

&gt;Musk's apparent idea that the supposedly unsophisticated auto industry didn't know how to manufacture came back to bite him when he learned firsthand how hard it is to make cars, learned that those legacy techniques work, and was forced to adopt them. ""That was a big miss on his part,"" Murphy says.

I have said before that I won't touch Tesla stock either way, because underestimating has proven a mistake, even in the face of obvious headwinds... but other manufacturers are releasing _135 EV models_ over the coming years, so something is going to stick. We've already seen demand exceeding supply for the F150 and Mach E.

&gt;""He is launching new product at a slower rate, he does not have a full product portfolio, so there is a huge opportunity for other competitors to shoot the gap and catch up,""

Tesla does not have a real SUV, they have hatchbacks. There is a huge market miss there. They don't have a truck, and that is a _huge_ moneymaker for auto manufacturers. They don't have anything compact or ""cheap.""

It's important to note after all of this that the share of cars being EV is increasing, so even with falling market share expect their production to increase. But I don't think it's going to be 90% of the market as some Tesla bulls predict.

Tesla's EV market share in Europe declined from 31% in 2019 to 13% in 2020. Last month it was 10% market share. A declining share can happen."|0.91|1753.0|0.0|1753.0|['the Bank of America', 'https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-general-motors-ford-shares-analysis-car-wars/\n\n&gt;Tesla']

I'm also guessing that $1200 per month can get my wife and I health insurance with maybe a 6k deductible. 

And I'm estimating that after 10 to 15 years we'll refinance the house and will owe less per month than current. 155k owed currently. Probably 100k owed in 10 years if we make a few extra payments here and there. 

I see s&amp;p500 is 10.5 percent annual returns before inflation adjustment and 7 percent adjusted. I assume 7 percent is the number I would use. 


Do I use a compound interest calculator for these growth projections? I know it's not a CD or a bond so I didn't know if compound calculator was the choice for this sort of investment. 



What savings goal should I realistically set? I'm not looking to nail it down to an exact number but I'd like to know if I'm in the right ballpark with my estimates. I keep coming up with between 1.8M and 2.5M depending on how I project my expenses. But if I need to be projecting my future inflation adjusted expenses then my numbers are too low... 



 I'm aiming for 28X my annual spending because I'll be a bit less than 50 years old when I may start reaching these portfolio values needed. So need to get 50 years out of the portfolio.



And my portfolio allocation is going to be 50 percent VTI and 50 percent VOO. I know it's a redundant mix. I currently have a lump sum of cash that I can DCA into the market over the next 18 months so I can change this allocation if needed."|0.82|342.0|0.0|342.0|['VOO', 'DCA', 'Healthcare']

&gt; Let’s start with PCE numbers for May: headline came in +0.6%, 3x what we saw the previous month but only a tick higher than the +0.5% analysts were expecting. When we strip out volatile food and energy costs, we get a “core” headline PCE read of +0.3%, 10 basis points (bps) below what analysts were expecting. This tells us the inflation pain was mostly on the food and energy side last month. Duh.

&gt; What most inflation-watchers, including the Fed, pay close attention to are the year-over-year PCE numbers, and here we’re pretty close to expectations as well: +6.3% on headline (in-line with estimates) and +4.7% on core (+4.8% expected, +4.9% in April). Of course, PCE data is drawn from a series of other economic inputs released previously, so surprises are usually modest at best.

&gt; Where we see some real mashing of the fruit last month is in the Income/Spending areas: while Personal Income gained +0.5% as expected, Real Personal Consumption posted a big drop-off: -0.4% versus a downwardly revised +0.3% the previous month. Adjusted consumption came in at half of expectations to +0.2%, following another downward revision to +0.6% the prior month.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/larry-summers-nailed-inflation-but-is-he-right-on-what-comes-next-11656343688

In February 2021, Larry Summers was right and I was wrong. The former Treasury secretary warned that President Biden’s stimulus package was far too large and would lead to far too high inflation. I was less worried and thought the Federal Reserve would be willing to raise interest rates to head off any inflationary problem. My faith was misplaced, and it took me until June to realize my mistake. The Fed waited another nine months to act.

Markets are finally focused on whether the Fed’s newfound hawkishness will start a recession—Prof. Summers thinks it will. There is a longer-term question that matters, too: Once inflation is finally brought under control, do we return to the post-2009 secular stagnation, or will there be a new paradigm? Here again I find myself disagreeing with Prof. Summers, who thinks the likelihood is we return to the status quo ante.

The question is far from academic for anyone thinking about how to position their portfolio in future years. A return to the miserable growth and excess savings of the decade before the pandemic sets up the same trade that prospered for years: long everything that benefits from the Fed going back to loose money. That would mean buying expensive technology stocks, bonds and private assets and ignoring cheap, economically sensitive cyclical stocks.

Prof. Summers set out the case over a late-afternoon dish of cured salmon at a London hotel.

“It’s 60-40 that we’re going back to something that’s kind of secular stagnation,” he said. Just as in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 recession, interest rates will be held down by increased savings resulting from an aging population and the uncertainty that comes after a crisis. Rapid technological development will again keep the cost of capital goods down. More savings and less investment means lower after-inflation interest rates are required to balance the economy.

He sees the threat of recession, even with 10-year bond yields at just over 3%, as strong evidence that he is right that the U.S. and the world can’t cope with higher rates.

“The fact that such low rates seem to be causing a recession is quite prohibitive,” he argues.

 HP dividend yield is 2.83% (according to google).

To me his actions don't make sense. 

Lets say if I have $100,000 to invest.

In the past people paid $100,000 to get 8% return (lets say in 2001), then paid $100,000 to get 5% return (lets say 2010), now recently people have been paying 100,000 to let a lousy 3% return (lets say 2020)

So if I am someone who invests for say income, for $100,000 I would have got $8,000, in 2001.

So in 2020, I would need around $270,000 to get around the same $8000.

If stock prices have been going up, because people have been chasing every lower returns e.g. 8% -&gt; 5% and now 3%    (largely because interest rates were going down)

The reason for people accepting lower returns is because interest rates kept falling, so people were okay with lower returns. 

Does that mean stock prices have fall, to entice investor to put money in those stocks?. If HP is paying 2.83%, I would want the stock price to fall, so that my return is say around 6%. 

As bank interest rates are rising, why would people put money in stock.

So for me, I would hold to cash, until returns improve?

What is Berkshire Hathaway seeing that I am not?

Sorry I have done bad job in explaining what I am trying to ask, but hopefully it will make sense to someone and may be they can re-write it or explain it in a simpler form?

To clarify - historically, it seems like many large cap stocks used to grow more steadily over the past few decades, doubling let's just say every 5 years on average. Obviously tech stocks grew much faster and there's been overall fluctuations in the market and plenty of outliers. But if I pull up any random major (non-Tech) corporation from the S&amp;P 500 that has existed since the 90s, they (more often than not) were growing at a fairly steady rate when you exclude broader market trends like the 2008 recession. 

That is, until post-COVID when everything went nutso. You could argue that the pace for many of them picked up even before that around 2016. 

So my curiosity is in trying to determine where these share prices would be if those broad market dips and recent rapid growth were normalized over the same time period. I'm not even sure that would be all that useful, but I think it would be interesting to see that growth in a vacuum (so to speak).

TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --&gt; $3750 --&gt; $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --&gt; higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors.

However, among institutional investors including pension funds, life assurance and more, an significant allocation (sometimes as much as 50%) to alternatives is standard. Examples include, long/short funds, commodity ETFs, precious metals, collectibles.

A number of academic studies and analysis by various asset managers has indicated a benefit to risk-return profiles of portfolios given an allocation (most sources suggest between 5-20% weight of total  portfolio) to alternatives. The performance of bonds and stocks in 2022  have largely been poor, and this time will be remembered as one of the rare times high quality bonds and stocks have both performed poorly at  the same time. Various alternatives such as infrastructure, commodities, and real estate have comparatively performed well YTD, showing their value in market conditions where stocks and bonds happen to show higher correlations, along with their long term ability to reduce volatility.  Many alternatives are poorly correlated or uncorrelated with stocks and  bonds, providing additional diversification.

(Bloomberg) -- On trading floors in New York and Hong Kong, the brightening mood toward Chinese technology companies is unmistakable: With stocks like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. surging from multi-year lows, talk of a new bull market is growing louder.

When speak to executives, entrepreneurs and venture capital investors intimately involved in China’s tech sector and a more downbeat picture emerges. Interviews with more than a dozen industry players suggest the *outlook is still far from rosy, despite signs that the Communist Party’s crackdown on big tech is softening at the edges.*

These insiders describe an ongoing sense of paranoia and paralysis, along with an unsettling realization that the sky-high growth rates of the past two decades are likely never coming back.

Alibaba (Baba) and Tencent  are expected to *deliver* ***single-digit revenue growth in 2022***\*, a letdown after years of rip-roaring expansion.\* One prominent startup founder said he’d pass on money from those companies because of the attention it would attract. Another said his company is proceeding on the assumption that it’s only a matter of time before officials double down again.

A third Beijing-based entrepreneur recently sold his stake in a tech unicorn and said he’s reluctant to start a new venture until there’s more clarity on what the government will allow.

“China’s tech crackdown has happened. There is no comeback from that,” the entrepreneur said, asking to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. “The regulatory pressure on Chinese tech companies may have hit the brakes for now, given the sluggish economy, but it’s unthinkable that regulators in the country would loosen their grip on platform companies ever again.”"|0.67|27.0|0.0|27.0|['the Communist Party’s', 'Tencent Holdings Ltd.', 'Bloomberg', 'Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.', 'Tencent']

I'm looking for a strategy to invest a large sum of money over 18 months.   


It looks like I'm getting priced out of the housing market with these rate hikes. So my plan is to  invest heavily in the stock market over the next year and a half. I'll be using my down payment and most of my pay check every month.   


My time frame is based on the average bear market being roughly 1 year and recovery being roughly 2 years. Along with DCA, I would also buy dips of a certain percentage, like 2% or something. So I expect my real time frame to be between 1 and  1.5 years.   


I want to DCA the down payment into a growth portfolio like VTI and QQQ. So this would leave a large portion as cash in the beginning that would shrink as I invest. I want to do something productive with the unspent cash.    


I was thinking of doing a second smaller DCA along side the growth DCA. The second smaller DCA would be a value/dividend portfolio. I would DCA into it over 12 months and DCA out over 12 months to get long term capital gains tax rates. I would start to exit the value portfolio only if I was in the green and then DCA into the growth portfolio.   


I'm building a spread sheet to work out the details. But I was hoping for constructive criticism or advice.   


Is my plan a good one? Are there better strategies? Any and all input is welcome.

t3_vjbd4l|1656030497.0|investing|How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?|"**How on Earth is Citi's Stock Price so Low!?**

Is there a stock as ridiculously underpriced as Citi (C)? Before the 2007-2008 crisis, Citi was trading at around $500/share and then abruptly crashed down to prices as low as $15/share before moderately rebounding to around $40/share in late 2009. Since 2009, Citi has been trading within the range of $40-$80/share despite enormous growth in the company's financials. Citi currently trades at roughly $50/share despite yielding annual free cash flows (FCFs) which are far, far, far greater than they ever did when its stock price was roughly $500/share. They had FCFs of \~$57 billion in 2021! And the 2022 Q1 report makes the rest of the year look extremely promising. If you took their Q1 2022 Net Income, ""extrapolated"" that figure for the entirety of 2022 by multiplying it by 4, and assumed the same Net Income/Free Cash Flow ratio as seen in 2021, you'd get a FCF number equal to around $44 billion! Both their actual 2021 FCF figure and this 2022 estimate are drastic improvements from prior years. But keep in mind that this ""back-of-the-envelope"" estimation calculation is most likely an underestimation for one big reason:

**RISING INTEREST RATES**

Banks make more money when interest rates rise. The Fed is raising and will continue to raise interest rates to recent records to combat the recent bout of inflation. Banks such as Citi stand to gain enormously from this.

Yet for some reason, the Fed's announcement of interest rate hikes in March barely had an effect on Citi's stock.

EDIT: Additionally, Warren Buffett recently invested an enormous amount in Citi, but that had very little effect on its stock price.

Every single DCF model I've seen of Citi yield Equity/Share values that are far, far, far higher than what the stock is currently trading for. Analysts widely seem to agree that Citi is undervalued and has been for several years.

Just for fun, I took the Free Cash Flows generated by Citi from 1989-2021 and used the Excel forecast function to use that data to create a forecast for the next 10 years within a 95% confidence interval. Thereafter, I took those FCF forecasts and used the ""terminal value"" method to come up with a NPV Enterprise value for the company (assuming a 5.5% WACC, as calculated by valueinvesting.io). I took this figure and subtracted the company's net debt to arrive at an equity value for the company. Afterward, I divided this equity value and divided it by Citi's shares outstanding. This is essentially how DCF models calculate a stock's ""intrinsic"" price. I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$254.68/share.**

But that's not all! I also did the same thing but used the FCF forecasts from the Lower Confidence Bound (meaning Excel is 95% sure that the actual values will be higher than these values). Thereafter, I averaged the results from the median forecast and the worst-case scenario (as it is extremely unlikely that Citi will actually yield FCF of around -$35 billion for every single year for the next 10 years). Averaging the median forecasts and the worst-case forecasts, I got an ""intrinsic"" price of **$56.55/share**! Keep in mind that this is basically the most realistic **worst-case scenario** for Citi's future FCFs.

**Citi is currently trading at $46.35/share.**

I've done tons of DCF models and my ""intrinsic value"" figure always ends up being pretty close to the actual stock price. This is virtually the only exception. How on Earth is Citi only trading at $46.35/share!? How is that even possible!?

for all the impatient:   
TLTR:   
here´s my approach: 

I look at a company in a sector that interests me or meets a certain criteria I set myself. 

then I take a look at a chart : stock price. then I zoom out , AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. depending on the tool I use, I try to see the complete history of the stock price ever since it was issued on one page. 

why do I do this ? because if it started trading 20+ years ago, the company already had to weather certain crisis, and major changes in local and global market situations. 

it changed leadership and strategy probably more than once. 

and it is something we can see exactly mirrored if you look at an index like the S&amp;P.

you see major dips for all black swan events that ever happened. and you see if it was able to bounce back at all. 

and depending on how the chart reacted to those events in time, I decide on putting it on my watchlist and eventually buy in. no matter the price. because long term, the company has proven to be resilient to basically all changes in markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

that´s it. 

let me know if this is just too simple. so far, it has worked extremely well.

and this is the topic I would love to get your opinions on and please keep in mind: I am solely talking about ""INVESTING"" -&gt; long term buying and holding of equity. no ""plays"", daytrading or any fancy ""make money fast"" approach. 

&amp;#x200B;

  


thank you guys.   


\--------------------------

*here comes the part where I try to explain WHY I am doing it this way. its optional to read.* 

as I am getting older, the more I realize the mistakes I made when I was young. 

when I started out, I was chasing ""opportunities"" to make as much money as fast as possible. I was gullible enough to listen to ""tips"" , invest in stocks that were extremely volatile, without any real clue what I was doing. 

fast forward 30 years. I would say I have a decent amount of life experience. I have a pretty good job that pays well. and since I got older, my approach to investing changed. 

even though I read several books about ""fundamental business analysis"", and several books about ""how to invest"", more and more I come to the conclusion that it´s all ""made up"". 

unless you have an extremely good understanding of what is really going on, any investment choice is directly correlated to risk  of at least freezing cash in a non-moving equity. given enough timeframe though, and given enough ""distance"", this can be mitigated.

one of the most common advice I read and see again and again is ""invest in good companies with strong fundamentals and a proven business model"".

now, you COULD start digging into financial reports.quarterly earnings and shareholder news. 

BUT: this will always and only tell you about the PAST. the more complex a business is, the more it is interconnected with international supply and value chains and markets, the harder it becomes to actually , even semi-realistically, predict future performance. 

in my personal opinion: most scenarios are way too complex for even the smartest people.   
there´s this saying that NO Investor / trader beat index investing in the long run. (barren a teeny tiny few exceptions. those are statistical anomalies, not the norm. most of them also started investing and trading WAY back when, when information wasn´t as easily available AND supply and value chains weren´t as complex and fast moving as they are now. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyways: since its hard to predict and foresee how even the best business will do in any given timeframe, I started to dumb down my research approach. 

we have plenty of data available about the past. and from an investor perspective, its all good, but the one thing that is the most important factor overall is not EBIT, cashlow, debt ratio or whatever:  its how share prices moved and developed. (and hopefully will develop)."|0.65|6.0|0.0|6.0|[]

Hear me out, we’ve been in a decades long slump in interest rates. Lower and lower and lower and lower.

The impact of this is that ETF bond distributions have been on a decade long slump. Do you think we could see a reversal such that your distributions would actually *increase* in the way dividend aristocrats increase their dividends every year thereby becoming the new “dividend growth” strategy but with coupons from bond ETF distributions instead?

Before you say no way we will in long term continue to lower rates in order to keep the machine going after every crisis, but what if there’s another way?

Instead of relying on rates, we instead increase or cut taxes to keep money in circulation or “suck it out” of the system whenever we need to prevent deflation spiral.

We cut debts to increase pent up demand.

We print money to increase inflation *in times where we want to prevent deflationary spirals*.

Finally, albeit controversial, we consider a CBDC which will cap consumption on goods that are inflating too much and offer benefits like more CBDC on things that are deflating too much.

All this happens while interest rates creep up in the background for the next  decades, thereby having coupons going up and up and as a result bond ETF distributions increasing as well.

As such, this would prevent the 1-day period, the ""day of,"" the trade, from being considered either *before* or *after* the trade.

It's clear that one would have to wait 31 days to be *outside* of the wash sale window of 30 days following a trade. I'm confused as to whether the day of the trade is considered *within* that 30 day period, or that 30-day period starts on the next day?

Essentially, I make a trade on Day 1 selling a position of XYZ. Does the 30day wait period start *on that day* or the *next day* ?

* Case 1 (same day): I can repurchase on the 30 + 1 = 31st day after my sale.
* Case 2 (next day): I can repurchase on the 1 (remaining same day) + 30 + 1 = 32nd day after my sale (or really like 31 + 1/2 or so)

Also, silly question, these are *calendar* days, not *business* days, correct?

It was involved in corruption cases and the previous owners mismanaged it... but now it is completely clean.

Past year OHLA earned money for first time in five years, and first quarter this year they had a small loss (but a profit on operating income).

This year has been a nightmare for OHLA as it has lost more than 40% of its value after rallying the first day of January. They are being awarded lots of public contracts (even several New York underground stations were built by them) and apart from infraestructure, OHLA also designs and builds power plants and solar panels, among other business segments.

I believe this only happens in times of rapidly rising fed rates, for obvious reasons- banks need a little time to catch up, or they are cashing in on people renewing at low rates without really checking for better rates. Probably a huge bonanza for banks since they can invest that same money easily and safely at almost 1 percent higher.

EDIT and as one commenter pointed out, you need to hold to maturity of 1 year for both Treasuries and CDs to get the full return. Unlike CDs you originated at a bank you don't get 100% face value/par back if you sell early, which makes sense since you are buying them at a discount, which represents all or part of the return in addition to interest, if any.

# The Strange Case Of Nakamoto’s Bitcoin - Part1

**Shams, Shakedowns, &amp; Swindles**

When I read through the [list of confidence tricks on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confidence_tricks) I’m struck by the boundless creativity that humans posses.  I imagine the millions of variations of scams and schemes that must have existed over the [lifetimes of 100 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population), and marvel at our ingenuity when it’s applied to making a quick buck.

From papyrus to protocols, the undiscovered country of criminality lies along the frontiers of new technology.  Ethical borders are easily crossed, and moral compasses ignored, when opportunity is plentiful and law is scarce.  Outright theft has always been relatively straightforward, but risky.  Why take by force what the gullible and guileless will volunteer?  Patience is a virtue, and the long con is where the big money is at.

Fraud’s foundations lie in the marriage of dishonesty and exploitation.  Beyond this, its taxonomy is arbitrary.  Many choose to assign fraud to a [category based on the specific goal or mechanism used](https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/types-of-consumer-fraud.html), while some experts suggest classification which first considers [group or individual targeting](https://longevity.stanford.edu/framework-for-a-taxonomy-of-fraud/).  Whatever our system, the limits of categorization quickly become apparent.  Some schemes target groups and individuals simultaneously.  Many scams borrow generously, their methods and mechanisms bleeding into one another, making them hard to pin down.  Categorizing fraud is an attempt to define the scope and range of all possible human behavior which uses deceit to exploit others for personal gain.  As a result, fraud’s internal boundaries can be unfocused.

While sometimes difficult, general categorization does help to provide clarity, specific instances of fraud are carefully examined and grouped based on their [*modus operandi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi).  Occasionally new groups are discovered and given names like [‘](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[Payroll Spoof](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[’](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[ or ‘](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[Ransomware](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm)[’](https://www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca/scams-fraudes/azindex-eng.htm).  It is by dissecting specific species of fraud that new genera are discovered in the wild.

Using this approach, we can think of the Madoff investment scam as a specific species of fraud which belongs to the genus Ponzi Scheme.  The Ponzi genus belongs to the family of Investment Fraud, which also contains the genus Pyramid Scheme.  Members of the same family are distinct, but often share similar characteristics and mechanisms.  We could say that the Madoff and Amway schemes are related, as their genera are both members of the Investment Fraud family.

As Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies in general, claim to be investments, yet have no underlying sources of revenue, many have viewed them with suspicion.  Some argue that Bitcoin is a Ponzi, while others counter that the comparison is erroneous as it shares traits with a pyramid scheme.   Surprisingly, despite intense scrutiny, Bitcoin has defied precise categorization as a specific form of investment fraud, leading some proponents to suggest that, as a result, it should be cleared of all charges, “*If it looks like a duck, but* *honks like a goose, then it can’t be either*”.

In actuality, categorizing the mother of all crypto as Ponzi or pyramid is an attempt to fit a square peg into a round hole.  Bitcoin is neither, it belongs to a new genus of fraud.  It has several specific qualities that make it unique, and many others that it shares with known forms of investment fraud, notably Ponzi and pyramid schemes.  By carefully examining Bitcoin’s construction and observing its relations with other forms of investment fraud, we can better understand the inner workings of the **Nakamoto scheme**.

# Odd Duck

Like a Ponzi, Bitcoin doesn’t specifically promote a need for liquidity or sales.  Like a pyramid, Bitcoin promotes, proselytizes, and preaches as realizing returns is dependent on new converts.

Like a Ponzi, Bitcoin doesn't sell the rights to acquire new members or sell products.  Like a pyramid, the right to sell something can be purchased, the ‘investment’ made during the mining process bestows Miners with the the right to sell the bitcoin they acquire.

Like a Ponzi, a Bitcoin investor’s returns don’t depend on their direct recruitment efforts.  Like a pyramid, a Bitcoin investors ability to realize returns depends on transactions with counter-parties recruited into the scheme.

Like a Ponzi, Bitcoin guarantees returns to investors.  Like a pyramid, Bitcoin investors entirely depend on recruitment to realize returns.

Bitcoin is a strange amalgam, and can best be described as an **extensible sub-fiat distributed virtual  investment fraud hybrid**, more easily referred to as a type of **Nakamoto Scheme**.

It is extensible because Bitcoin is a digital network and can be used as a scaffolding onto which other forms of investment fraud can be grafted (Ponzi, Pyramid, Pump and Dump).  It is sub-fiat, in that the initial investment in the scheme is not made with dollars, but with a commodity, as electricity is wasted during the mining process, giving the scheme a naturally occurring fiat on-ramp and valuation mechanism.  It is distributed, as the mining process creates a level playing field, a fair market, where a stake in the scheme can be purchased.  It is virtual, in that the scheme provides virtual returns which can only be realized via fraud which enables additional fiat on-ramps. It is an investment fraud hybrid, in that it shares many of the same characteristics and mechanisms that are found in related investment frauds.

We’ve known for some time that Bitcoin resembles other types of investment scams, so let’s take a look at what qualifies the Nakamoto scheme as a novel form of fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Growing the flock**

Up until 2009, fraud could be conducted over digital networks, but Bitcoin is the world’s first case of investment fraud which is a digital network.  Because participants and software can interact with the network, new systems can be created which allow the extension of further schemes.

Centralized exchanges can be built which enable more traditional forms of financial schemes.  Exchanges can leverage insider information, or wash trade to manipulate prices, or they can front run clients to liquidate leveraged positions.  It is even possible conduct unregulated fractional reserve crypto-banking by selling synthetic bitcoin to customers.

Typically con-artists prefer to keep their schemes to themselves, but allowing others to build on top of Bitcoin helps to legitimize the scheme and attract liquidity from a wider audience.

**Taking Wing**

The most important, and most novel mechanism in the Nakamoto scheme is the way in which Proof-of-work (PoW) is leveraged and combined with mining rewards.  Originally, Hashcash’s PoW was proposed as a way to discourage e-mail spam or denial of service attacks by forcing senders to expend CPU time, and hence electricity.  Electricity costs money, and while the cost is small, it will scale with the number of emails sent, or connection attempts made.  This method of using PoW explicitly ties it to some type of **utility** being provided.  In contrast to the ethical ethos of hyper-financialization found in crypto, this method was preferred to [email micropayments as it avoided the administrative and moral issues related to charging for e-mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash).

In it’s original form, PoW expends electricity, but the **value** of that wasted electricity is a **cost** required to provide **utility.**  Because the goal of this system is to provide some good or service (**resource**), a price ceiling is established based on the subjective value of being able to send an email.

Nakamoto’s genius lay in realizing they could hijack proof-of-work to kill four birds with one bitcoin.

**Bird 1 – The Investment Vehicle**

Firstly, Nakamoto inverted Hashcash’s PoW.  Instead of being used to provide utility, the electricity expended by PoW could be tethered to the value of a digital token by a reward mechanism. In Nakamoto’s incarnation, participants have a chance to receive a reward in the form of bitcoin by conducting PoW calculations.  This process is referred to as mining, and it transforms the expenditure demanded by PoW from a cost into an ‘investment’ in the mind of the Miner.  To participants, the bitcoin they mine has intrinsic value equal to the amount of money spent to mine it (electricity + capital + other operating costs). This gives the token a concrete value for everyone who participates in the mining scheme, and creates the foundations for a market by providing a universal valuation mechanism.

As it does not concern itself with providing utility, Bitcoin’s only goal is value.  A price floor is created based on the amount of electricity used to generate a bitcoin.  To realize returns, Miners must exchange the tokens for a greater amount of value than the cost of electricity used to generate them. Instead of PoW being used to provide a good or service, what we might call a resource, it’s purpose is inverted to transform a cost into an investment.  To those who have been lured into mining, the ‘value’ of this investment is equal to the cost of electricity that they have used to generate the token.

Real economic exchanges involve the transfer of value for the utility of a resource, we give the baker money and in exchange receive our daily bread.  Real investments are expenditures, where we exchange value for something that will possibly return a greater amount of value to us in the future. With investments we are purchasing the utility of possible future returns.  Real Investments can be considered assets because they have mechanisms which can generate positive economic output, these mechanisms exist within a legal framework which defines them and enforces rules about their operation.  If you remove the legal framework and all mechanisms for generating positive economic output, then what you are left with is not an asset.  If value is exchanged in an economic transaction, but no good or service (resource) is returned, then no utility can be derived as there is no resource to consume.

&amp;#x200B;

[***FIGURE 2 - In Hashcash value is exchanged for the utility provided by a resource.   Cost a and b are acceptable, but the subjective value of email is less  than the cost of c, as a result a price ceiling is formed and value c  will not be spent.  In Bitcoin PoW there is no ceiling or natural limit  as these are exchanges of value for value.  Because the cost associated  with PoW is re-framed as an investment, a price/investment floor will be  established.  The utility which is provided in this implementation is  not an end, but a means by which investors convert virtual returns into  real returns.***](https://salbayat.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fraud-PoW-low-1024x501.png)

&amp;#x200B;

All investment frauds attempt to change the nature of economic interactions from ones that trade value for the utility provided by resources, to ones that trade value for value.  Traditional schemes will seek to camouflage this subversion of utility and removal of revenue generation by hiding the fact that there are no underlying mechanisms that generate positive economic output.  We see this in the case of Ponzi and pyramid schemes.

For Bitcoin, external camouflage is unnecessary as its inversion of resources (provided utility) for value in proof-of-work means the system is premised on the exchange of value for value.  However, from the perspective of those participating in the scheme, Bitcoin is a logically consistent economic system as participants believe that the act of wasting electricity is a resource which provides utility, this resource is then exchanged for value by way of mining rewards.  Within the belief structure of the system Miners are like a business whose ‘investments’ fund the production of resources.  The protocol then exchanges value (bitcoin) to the Miners for the resource they produce.

Miners view what they produce as a resource which they exchange for value, however, because Bitcoin’s PoW is inverted, in the real world, Miners produce an externality, wasted electricity which amounts to an economic and environmental cost, just as it does in the Hashcash implementation.

In a Ponzi scheme, the more you invest, the greater your potential returns, investors are limited by the amount of money they have to contribute.  In a pyramid scheme, the more you work to recruit, the greater your potential returns, investors are limited by the amount of work they can do.  The Nakamoto scheme is unique in that its PoW implementation produces a blend of psychological elements from both schemes.  Potential returns are only limited by the amount of money Miners put to work, the scheme can appeal to their greed, as well as depend on a sense of entitlement to their returns as they have ‘worked’ for them.  The Nakamoto Scheme achieves the best of both worlds, it produces the psychological buy-in we see from pyramid schemes and creates a ponzi like investment structure that is less constrained as it benefits from indirect recruitment.

By creating an automated system that tethers a representation of value (bitcoin) to the value of electricity expended through PoW, the foundations of a fraudulent investment scheme are born.

**Bird 2 - Stake** **~~Ownership~~** **Distribution**

Secondly, Nakamoto combined bitcoin rewards with PoW to create a distributed scheme.  Running a distributed confidence game has many benefits but it also poses problems.  Sharing profits in the scheme helps to legitimize it and produce a network effect.  This greatly increases the reach of the scheme, which results in greater total liquidity invested into it, and as a consequence leads to greater returns extracted by co-operators.  Trust is an issue though, and the creator of the scheme needs a way to place themselves on even footing with potential co-operators.  Understandably, potential participants are less likely to trust in the scheme if up front demands for money are made.

Please note that I have settled on the usage of the word stake instead of ownership because, bizarrely, Bitcoin does not actually have a concept of ownership as we typically understand it.  Miners gain initial custodial ownership of a bitcoin, but the only right that is granted by this ‘ownership' is the right of sale.  All other rights typically afforded to owners are missing.

Instead of investing by giving money to a centralized authority, interested parties are asked to waste resources as a proxy for investment.  By requiring the consumption of a commodity to buy in on the ground floor and acquire stake in the scheme, Bitcoin is able to create a fair playing field as the PoW mechanism does not favour a particular participant.  This is an ‘honest’ way of determining stake in an open investment fraud.  As no central operator is taking the money invested, the stake acquisition process is more trustworthy and attractive to potential co-operators.

If I wanted to distribute stake in the analog world it would be much more difficult to provide a level playing field.  I could provide a way to certify that co-operators set fire to fiat currency, and then match their ‘investment’ by compensating them with an unforgeable coin equal in value to the amount of fiat burned.  However, this system has major drawbacks, as I could collude with investors to fake the fiat destruction, or some participants might attempt to use counterfeit currency.  Moreover, the process scales poorly, limiting the pool of potential participants.

When compared to an analog equivalent, Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work and coin rewards are an obviously superior method for creating an open distributed investment fraud, a key requirement for the  Nakamoto Scheme.

**Bird 3 - Guaranteed Returns**

Thirdly, Nakamoto needed a way to guarantee returns to investors.  The scheme had an investment vehicle, a way to value the investment, a mechanism to distribute stake, and a fair playing field that could serve as the foundation of a market, but it was missing a hook, the incentive that encourages participation.  In Bitcoin, it is the halving schedule for mining rewards which not only promises returns to investors, but actually delivers on them.

Bitcoin has a planned total money supply of 21,000,000 bitcoins and approximately 19 million are currently in circulation.  Nakamoto tied coin rewards to the PoW system whose supposed primary purpose is to select a Miner who can write data to a shared ledger.  The Bitcoin protocol adjusts its hashing difficulty so that a cryptographically hashed block of data can be written to the ledger every 10 minutes.  These blocks of data contain bitcoin transactions.

The Miner who guesses a hash that meets the difficulty requirements is able to write a block of data to the ledger.  All other work is discarded by Miners who failed to guess the correct hash.  As part of this process, the successful Miner includes an additional transaction where they are awarded a number of bitcoins.  This reward acts as an incentive for Miners to conduct the work necessary to maintain the Bitcoin system.  In 2009 Miners were rewarded with 50 bitcoin for writing a block to the ledger, however, every 210,000 blocks (around every 4 years) this reward halves, and in 2022, after 13 years, the current mining reward is 6.25 bitcoin.

Proof-of-work creates the investment vehicle, but it is the halving schedule which guarantees virtual investor returns.  A Miner who generates 50 bitcoin by using $50 of electricity will value their bitcoin at $1.  However, due to the halving schedule, in 4 years, to acquire another 50 bitcoins, the Miner will need to invest $100.  As they are fungible, any bitcoin mined before the halving date is mined at a discount.  After the halving date passes, the Miner must invest $2 per bitcoin in order to mine them.  The Miner has doubled their money in 4 years, equivalent to approximately 19% APY.

After halving a Miner must make twice the investment to earn the same rewards, the existing bitcoin have, effectively, doubled in value.  The Bitcoin protocol guarantees these returns.  Amazingly, within the context of the Bitcoin system, these returns are real, however, as a non-participant we would refer to these returns as virtual (and fraudulent), as they exist in the native digital token and not as fiat currency.

Moreover, because other Miners have started participating over those 4 years, the hash rate and hence difficulty of finding the correct hash has increased.  This means that overtime it has become more expensive to earn a bitcoin, meaning that it is possible that your investment has more than doubled after halving.  The halving doubles the value of a bitcoin at the time the halving occurs. Referencing our earlier example, if the Miner had invested $1 per bitcoin mined, but just before halving it took $4 of electricity to mine a bitcoin, post halving, the value of a bitcoin would be $8.  The Miner is up 8x on their initial investment.

It should be noted that the combination of PoW, bitcoin rewards, and the halving schedule produce information asymmetries that lead to arbitrage opportunities.  Some Miners may be more efficient in their production of bitcoin, leading to slightly different valuations.  Moreover, some Miners and speculators may be more savvy in regards to Bitcoin’s true nature and fundamental mechanisms, leading them to acquire bitcoin in anticipation of greater virtual returns.

These guaranteed returns offer an extremely strong incentive to participate in the system as early as possible. However, virtual returns come with a catch.  Investors can only realize the returns in fiat currency if they recruit others into the system.  This is effectively **a halfway point between a Ponzi and a pyramid scheme** and is a staggeringly brilliant innovation in deception.  **Virtual** returns that can only be realized if fiat liquidity is recruited into the fraud. The Nakamoto scheme is a masterpiece, and its creator a gifted idiot savant, or the Einstein of con artists.

**Bird 4 - Realizing Virtual Returns**

Fourthly, Nakamoto realized that PoW could be used to provide the **utility** of irreversible bitcoin ownership transfers, allowing participants to realize virtual returns either by trading bitcoin for goods and services, or for fiat currency. Bitcoin’s distributed append-only ledger allowed Miners to trade their bitcoin to one another, or to speculators, and no double spending meant a fair playing field to realize  returns through fraud.  This created a speculative marketplace where outside liquidity could be on-boarded into the scheme, the value of a mined bitcoin would not be constrained by the amount of electricity used to produce it.  This is the mechanism that enables the ponzi and pyramid like aspects that we are familiar with in Bitcoin and the reason why the scheme is dependent on disinformation, propaganda, and indoctrination, as recruitment is necessary to realize returns.

Have you ever wondered why Bitcoin makes such a poor payment network?  Why Nakamoto ignored or sidestepped questions on the transactional performance of Bitcoin and instead would focus on bandwidth?  What about the transactional profile of Bitcoin being far closer to something used to register real estate transactions, rather than a global payment network?  The answer is clear, transactions in Bitcoin are not meant to facilitate payments in the typical sense, they are useful insofar as they allow Miners and speculators to realize returns on their investments.

A speculative and deflationary ‘asset’ makes for a poor currency, people are disincentivized from using it today, as it might be worth considerably more tomorrow.  [This very criticism was leveled against Bitcoin on the BitcoinTalk forums in February 2010, as the design of coin rewards combined with the halving schedule rendered the protocol useless as a currency](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=57.0).  Few would spend something whose value appreciated 19% every year.  Nakamoto participated in this very forum thread and was well aware of the criticism, but shrewdly chose not to address the issue directly, ever careful to misdirect, lest too much attention be paid to Bitcoin’s fatal flaws.

By creating the narrative that these ownership transfers were entirely for payments, that Bitcoin was intended to be a form of electronic cash, Nakamoto was able to internally camouflage the true purpose of PoW and Bitcoin, the creation of a new form of investment fraud driven by speculation, and dependent on outside transfers of value in the form of fiat liquidity to realize virtual returns.

# Quoth the Raven

Bitcoin is not a form of electronic cash.  Bitcoin is not a store of value.  Bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation.  Nor is it digital gold, the future of finance, or an investment.  Bitcoin is a type of Nakamoto scheme, a form of investment fraud which leverages an unsound economic premise to enable transactions where no utility is exchanged.  The scheme is characterized by several unique properties:

* The tethering of a speculative digital token to a cost in order to create the illusion of an investment.
* The creation of a mechanism which can distribute stake in the scheme so that there are multiple co-operators instead of a single operator, i.e. a distributed open investment fraud.
* Virtual investment rewards are delivered to co-operators, these returns are not fraudulent to participants operating within the system’s context (to an outside observer they are fraudulent returns).
* As the scheme provides no underlying mechanisms to generate revenue, virtual returns can only be converted into real returns if participants become co-operators in subsequent investment frauds which enable the inflow of fiat liquidity.  A built in mechanism which allows the transfer of the digital token is used to convert virtual returns into goods and services or fiat currency.

These properties can be used to distinguish the scheme from more traditional forms of investment fraud like Ponzi and pyramid schemes.

**Proof-of-Stake**

Bitcoin inverts resources for value with proof-of-work to enable a new form of investment fraud; however, proof-of-stake (PoS) also enables value for value exchanges.  Although PoS systems are not sub-fiat and provide a less robust fair playing field to distribute stake, they are a more efficient, though less deceptive, form of Nakamoto scheme.  PoS allows a scheme to more effectively provide access to fiat liquidity, not only can we do away with an expensive stake distribution process, but there is no need to wait for the organic growth of subsequent investment schemes which provide exit liquidity for co-operators.

‘Investors’ provide seed money to an organization in exchange for tokens which guarantee virtual investment returns (fraudulent returns) by way of a staking mechanism.  This organization is then delegated with certain responsibilities.  It is tasked with creating promotional materials, such as a whitepaper, purchasing advertising, handling media relations, and creating some amount of demonstrable functionality.  Although the system will provide some form of functionality, due to the performance limitations of distributed append-only ledgers, this functionality will never be able to compete with existing in-market solutions, and hence there will never be a source of significant revenue which can compensate investors for their initial allocation of funds.  No resources, and hence no provided utility, are being exchanged for investor value.

The true purpose of this organization is not to create a product, but to promote their scheme to potential victims and work with existing scams like cryto exchanges, in order to provide exit liquidity for their investors.  As these centralized entities are doing a great deal of the heavy lifting to provide exit liquidity, we would expect that they would take a greater percentage of the profits and, as a result, we would expect to see more centralization in terms of token distribution (higher gini coefficient) in proof-of-stake systems vs. proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

Proof-of-Stake crypto systems are a type of Nakamoto scheme as they fulfill all of our criteria, with slight modifications in that they provide a less robust but more efficient stake distribution mechanism, and centralize the development of subsequent investment frauds to enable inflows of fiat liquidity.

**Crash Landing**

The Nakamoto scheme is substantively different than a Ponzi or pyramid scheme and far more deceptive.  It leverages digital technology to create a form of economic disinformation which weaponizes investment fraud.  Tethering cost to a speculative digital token, which guarantees virtual returns but does not provide utility, is a fraudulent act that should be banned.  All systems which enable value for value transactions, where no underlying utility is provided in the exchange, drink from a poison chalice.

The most dangerous lies are the ones that we want to believe, and from alchemy to airdrops, the fantasy of getting something from nothing to get rich quick is commonly pressed into the service of exploitation.  This lie is so powerful that when a stranger holds it up to us as a promise of freedom, we are willingly deceived, careful to avoid peering too closely at what lay beyond the curtain of our own self-interest.  Instead we coat and varnish the ugly truth until it gleams, its dark heart hidden even from ourselves.  The cryptocurrency industry is rotten at its core; based on a carefully orchestrated deception, it cannot serve as the basis for rational economic exchanges.

Freedom is only possible where rights have space to exist, and for a technology that brands itself as the personification of liberty, Bitcoin is devoid of substance.  This absence does not stem from a lack of regulation, it is that Bitcoin does not contain anything that can be regulated.  There is nothing here and no room for freedoms, except the right to sell a bitcoin.  Hot air and hype cannot serve as the foundation for an economic system, and the creation of rules within the context of an investment fraud is madness.

Bitcoin uses a corrupted implementation of proof-of-work to recruit co-operators into an investment fraud and distribute its function.  It creates an investment vehicle in the form of a speculative digital token which guarantee returns.  The delivery of these virtual returns incentivize recruitment of fiat liquidity into the scheme, as the only way to realize profits is to find a greater fool.  These mechanisms align the self-interest of participants, and this alignment serves as a powerful force that ensures all co-operators act in concert to increase the value of a bitcoin by as much as is possible and extend the fraud to the furthest reaches of our civilization.

Using cryptographic hashing techniques to create an append only ledger is not in and of itself exploitative.  However, creating a mechanism that enables economic transactions where value is exchanged for value can only serve as a vehicle for fraud.  Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency systems as they exist in their present form are examples of harmful technology.  They are dangerous and should not be allowed to exist. Value must be tied to the utility provided by a resource, and not to deception or an externality.  By defining the unique characteristics of the Nakamoto scheme, we are better positioned to identify them so that we may act accordingly when they are encountered.

As it turns out, “*If it looks like a duck, but* *honks like a goose, then it’s probably related to both*”.

\-----------------------------------------------------

**NOTE:**  Nakamoto agrees with me on how Bitcoin is initially valued, as in the early years there was no 'market' to determine price. In the quote below, Nakamoto correctly predicts that subsequent inflows of fiat liquidity will affect how Bitcoin is priced, and hence how Miners choose to value what they produce.  Nakamoto understood the two phases of their scheme, the initial distribution of the scheme followed by ingestion of fiat through secondary fraud.

""*In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's  estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service  (thanks).  The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the  production cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows  down.  If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and  selling more.  At the same time, the increased production would increase  the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.*

\- The Dot Com Bubble peaked around March 2000. It bottomed out in Sep 2002. Any ideas why it took so long? Was it due to Septmber 11 or the 2001 recession? Any other significant factors I'm missing here. Did the enron situation have a major impact?

\- Another signal is the average time since the start of the downturn/market turbulence.

In the last major recession the peak was around June 2007 and it bottomed out around March 2009, around 21 months.

\- I'm also looking at the situation with the speculative assets in each of these major downturns, as they have been significantly depreciated near the bottoms (speculative tech stocks were down 90%-99% near the bottom of the dot com bubble, the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index was down 20% two years after the 2007 peak)

\- Currently Bitcoin, GME, and NFTs have still not fully depreciated to 90%+. Housing is still expensive, while the price probably won't decline like it did in 2007, I'd still expect a correction with the interest rates and layoffs.

t3_vg8qa8|1655685125.0|investing|Why a Yield Inversion Means Nothing For Your Portfolio|"## The Historical Performance of Inversions:

Using Portfolio Visualizer gives us access to S&amp;P 500 data starting from 1985. This leaves us with three data points spread over a period of 30+ years and two more that we have not seen fully play out yet.

[1988-1990 Yield Inversion + Crash data](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91bc332c-c5dc-44c3-8afc-3ce11a850a79_1200x742.png)

In the first inversion and crash, we can see an outperformance by investing at the bottom of the market. However, it’s not near as much as you would expect from investing directly at the bottom. Five years after the crash the CAGR from the bottom is just under 2% higher than if we had just weathered the crash. By year twenty there is no discernable difference, in fact, ***buying at the bottom of the market underperformed!***

In this case, the 1988 inversion might be an outlier because in all of the other instances the margin of outperformance is larger.

[1998-2002 Inversion + Crash](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb34497b8-eed3-46b6-ae96-20f1db4ca9dc_1200x742.png)

I really wish there were more data points like this to analyze, but unfortunately, Portfolio Visualizer only goes back to 1985. However, I think we can still make some good observations given we have a 30+ year time window worth of information.

Still, across all of these charts, there is a noticeable trend that outperformance by buying at the bottom decreases over time. Under no circumstances did the gap actually increase. My intuition says that this is most likely because markets have a [mean-reverting nature](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanreversion.asp) when it comes to their return.

This can be demonstrated by some simple math, let’s say hypothetically that 90% of the time the market return is 10%. The other 10% of the time the market returns range from +30% to -30%.

If at the beginning of a 10-year period we experience a 30% decline in the market then statistically it is likely that the other nine years will have a 10% return.

We can take a look at this in an [investment calculator](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&amp;ctargetamountv=1000000&amp;cstartingprinciplev=10000&amp;cyearsv=1&amp;cinterestratev=-30&amp;ccompound=annually&amp;ccontributeamountv=0&amp;cadditionat1=end&amp;ciadditionat1=monthly&amp;printit=0&amp;x=80&amp;y=15) and a [CAGR calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/finance/cagr) to see that the returns and account value look as follows:

Year 1: $7000 CAGR: -30%

Year 2: $7700 CAGR: -12.25%

Year 3: $8470 CAGR: -5.38%

Year 4: $9317 CAGR: -1.75%

Year 5: $10,248.70 CAGR: 0.49%

Year 6: $11,273.57 CAGR: 2.02%

…

Year 10: $16505.63 CAGR: 5.14%

As you can see, over time the initial 30% dump matters much less on the overall return (even though from an account value standpoint, it could mean a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars, but even then, those hundreds of thousands make up a fraction of the entire account size).

This aforementioned phenomenon explains this graph:

[Difference between CAGR from Inversion and CAGR from the bottom of the market over time](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8aafb6df-a986-4d9f-aa59-4dcc0b74dae3_1200x742.png)

So pretty much, if we want to profit from a yield inversion, we would literally have to predict the exact bottom of the market. **AND** even if we did that, the historical performance shows that we still might end up behind.

But just as an experiment, let’s see how much of an edge we lose by being a couple of months off of the bottom of the market when we buy.

[CAGR based on the month](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd85e7d-8bf2-4f15-8d5b-353e589471d1_1200x742.png)[ invested in the 1998-2002 crash](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd85e7d-8bf2-4f15-8d5b-353e589471d1_1200x742.png)

If you are able to get within 10 months of the market bottom, (either before or after) the worst you can do is **beat the market by 1% annually.** This holds up even out to the twenty-year threshold. Which according to our investment calculator, amounts to about a 19% bigger nest egg.

But…

This is not as generous as it seems. Say you make a compromise between the median and mean number of months from the inversion to the market bottom (about 25 months).

You wait for an inversion and then pull all your money out of the market. You do this for 25 months regardless of the current market climate before reinvesting…

Only four out of the seven times in the last forty years would you have been within the range. That’s barely better than a coin toss!

Apply the same idea with REITs, when banking sector does well real estate does well, so REITS go up with banks.

As many know, ETFs are claimed to be superior by all counts compared to individual stock picking. For a dividend growth investor like myself, I did a little more digging to see if this is true.

I took the some of the top holdings from a dividend ETF called ZDV that tracks the top dividend aristocrats in Canada, and the distribution growth rate is no where near the dividend growth rate of the underlying securities!

Here's a bit of the calculations to show you what I mean:

[https://dividendchannel.com/symbol/zdv.ca/](https://dividendchannel.com/symbol/zdv.ca/)

As you can see, the ETF does not really increase it's distributions, when I averaged it out on a yearly basis, it came around to 1. something per cent in growth which doesn't even keep up with inflation.

Comparatively, if you were to hold the underlying holdings, you would be way better off:

RBC has a yearly increase from the past 5 years of 6.3% which is one of the funds biggest holdings.

Enbridge, another large holding increases by almost 10% a year!

Do this with all of the holdings and you'll see that they are increasing *far more* than what the fund does...

The same idea applies with their US dividend fund...

So my question is, can anyone give me a reasonable explanation as to why this is the case?

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen in recent days more posts about people questioning their DCA habit (should I pause it ? should I put more? should I put less?). The usual answers on r/bogleheads (and perhaps even here?) are either ""*time in the market beats timing the market*"" , ""*you can't time the market so just don't think/ask*"" and/or ""*if you're so sure it's going down even more : why don't you just short the market ?*"".

&amp;#x200B;

My concern with such answers is they don't provide any **factual proof** that during a 1)**clear** 2)**long** bear market (it's even a crash), changing the **way** we DCA is not better than just acting like a robot and waiting 3 or 5 years to break even. In short my concern is about **optimization during crashes** like this current one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To be practical, let's take my case :

\- I've DCAed (monthly) about 70k€ in VWCE ETF (**724 shares / average price : 98.75€**)

\- it's currently at \~90€ (**-9%** for me)

\- my current (potential) loss : \~-6000€

&amp;#x200B;

If it goes at -20% I would be losing 10k€ , if -30% : 18k€ etc...

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 2 options :

\- A)keep **DCAing monthly** and it it gets very low I would have to wait years to get back to 0%,

or

\- B)**sell now**, losing 6000€  and using those 65k€ to buy VWCE back when it will be at 74€ (**-30%** from its january's highest : nothing absurd or crazily pessimistic) : 884 shares. Hence a 21k-6k=\~**16k€ gain**. Plus a shortened time at a potential loss position.

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked about this on other subreddits, people were unanimously against B), saying I can't time the market successfully (*saying this crisis is clearly at least as bad at the previous recent ones and hence the market can't stop at a -20% decrease is now called ""timing the market""?!*) and, perhaps more strange, that A) is good enough &amp; the time I will lose on the way up isn't important ""on the long run""...

&amp;#x200B;

So : **what am I not seeing that seems so obvious to everyone ?** One part of me thinks, indeed, ""*if it was so easy why everyone isn't selling now to do the same in 1 or 3 months?*"" but I can't find practical (read mathematical) arguments against it ...

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT : wow! It's amazing how many people commented so fast, and gave extremely well argued answers. Based on the comments, I now get where my confusion came from : thinking what is ""easy"" on paper can be implemented as easily (ignoring my psychology). Also, from some comments, it seems I don't consider ""timing the market"" what most people consider it to be :)

So, I will keep DCAing , perhaps just adjusting the amount and/or frequency a little for some psychological coherence.

Back then, interest rates were close to zero, inflation was low, and there was no risk of a coming recession. **Now, all those things have changed for the worse, but the share prices are still higher than they were back when things were sunny**.

But yet we see massive sell offs from apparently emotional people who can't handle the pressure causing the price to collapse. I'm now starting to wonder whether holding is really the best strategy. I made a profit of a few thousand profit at it's peak before the announcements of interest rates. Now I knew shares were going to fall and they've been falling since as interest rates keep increasing. Again, not surprising, everyone saw this coming. But yet because I've been conditioned to just hold, I did. Now I'm thinking wouldn't it be better to sell now, take the profits and re-invest a few months later?

My contention is that this time is truly different.  Hear me out.

During 2001-2003, while the overall equity markets were down each of the three years, there was still money to be made in commodities, fixed income, and precious metals.

In 2008, which is the worst market of all our lifetimes, one could make money in alternatives, fixed income (especially taxable income), and healthcare.

Even in 1973-74, there was money to be made in T-Bills, T-Bonds, and real estate.

This year has been different. There is money to be made in commodities especially with energy.  The only other sector that has been profitable is agriculture.  What seems to make this different, is that the more traditional hedges against down markets such as fixed income and precious metals have been losers too. The last time we had a market that was down over -20% and the treasury bond index was negative was in 1931. It appears we are in new territory for many of us, including professionals. This is function of rising interest rates from historical lows and an uncertain future for the global economy.  Based on inflationary numbers, every country on this planet is feeling it.

t3_ve9t80|1655460795.0|investing|Investors on Reddit have a clear US bias. Here is why you should consider other countries too|"US total market cap as % of GDP is much higher compared to the rest of the world. This number is currently at 150% compared to 120% for Japan, 100% UK and only around 60% for Eurozone. The gap has narrowed over the last few months (US was at 200%), but remains well above historical averages. USD also appreciated by 20% against most other currencies during this period making other markets cheaper.

Now there are good reasons why these markets have a lower valuation. Namely slower growth and demographics. But at the same time I think it more than compensates by being cheaper. 

Consider the Eurozone which is almost 3x cheaper. Structural issues, high debt, Russia conflict. But the countries are working on structural improvements and integration. With the UK gone it will be much easier. Japan has the demographics issue and high debt too. However, yen is currently at a 24 year low, there is no inflation and a massive structural opportunity for higher labour participation and foreign investment. These are areas that the government is working on.

Let's go a bit further and consider some emerging markets. My two favourites are Poland and Indonesia. 

Poland is roughly the size of Spain in terms of population and size, and has a third of its debt. It has one of the best growth prospects in the EU. Excellent geographic location close to the centre. A bridge between east and west. Will massively benefit from the coming integration of Ukraine. However, the total market cap of all public companies there is $180bn. That is roughly the market cap of Adobe. Spain in comparison has a market cap of $800bn.

Indonesia has a market cap of around $400bn which is the size of Nvidia and smaller than Tesla. This is a country with a population almost the same size as the US. Has a huge young working age population that will continue to grow over the next decade fuelling consumption. The country is growing at 5-6% a year. It is arguably becoming one of the next large, low-cost manufacturing centres with many companies abandoning China. 

TLDR: US is expensive and its dominance may not last forever. You would be wise to diversify into the currently cheap global markets. Please due your own DD."|0.59|28.0|0.0|28.0|['Eurozone', 'EU', 'USD', 'Tesla']

I don't know what China/India did before the Russian/Ukranian invasion. A blend of various nations I'm sure, just like any other country. The narrative being passed around is currently ""they purchased less oil from Russia than compared to now"". 

If all we did (the US + ""morally upstanding countries"") was (partially) move our supplier from Russia to Saudis (or whoever could fill the gap in demand), and all China + India did was move their supplier from Saudis to Russia (giving Saudis more supply to sell it us), where is the actual shift in the overall supply/demand that is driving gas to be elevated?

Let's assume demand is/has been relatively constant (if anything it's declining because people are driving less now that it's high but that's irrelevant in my opinion).

Let's assume zero countries can magically flip a switch and come up with more supply (they don't want to for profitability reasons/they literally can't do it on a dime).

I'm well aware that nobody would want to invest short term (1-5 years) in oil because the current macroeconomic picture is a world that at least attempts to move away from fossil fuels in the name of climate change concerns/a hope for an Earth with less global ""pollution"" / ""greenhouse gases"".

t3_vdp537|1655394860.0|investing|Robinhood (HOOD) is Below its Intrinsic Value, and it is likely to Rise when High-Risk Retail Leave their Platform|"**Prelude**: Robinhood is a financial brokerage that is customarily abused by retail traders and degenerates to trade stocks and options, mostly options. Even though Robinhood gained plenty of ground in early 2021 and was trading at about $70 a share, it has now cratered to about 10% of its peak price. Currently, on June 16th, 2022, Robinhood is trading at about $6.80 a share. Robinhood is fundamentally undervalued, even though it may have a bit more to fall.

**Assets VS Liabilities, Intrinsic Value:** On December 31, 2022, Robinhood had $19.77 Billion in assets, and it also had $12.5 Billion in liabilities. What's even better is that most of these assets are liquid, cash, and account receivables. If all assets were subtracted by their liabilities, they would be worth about $8.42 a share. That's a raw undervaluation of about 25%.

**Robinhood is Losing its Users but Only Their Bad Ones:** Robinhood in last quarter's earnings call lost about 10% of its users year over year due to market panic. (15.9 million monthly users VS 17.7 million) I figure that these users were mostly dead weight. If you think about Robinhood's business structure, you would figure out that they sell user information to hedge funds in order to manipulate the market, I mean track retail performance. These are low-quality users, the ones that are leaving, stay on their platform for a temporary period of time, and they are at high risk as they trade options. These low-quality users seem to dilute Robinhood's aggregate worth to hedge funds. The users that stay on the platform after the market crash are likely to be more conservative, and they are likely to stay longer, which means Robinhood will have a more consistent revenue stream that is also worth more per user. This can be proven through the increase in their Assets Under Custody, which increased to $93.1 Billion from $80.9 Billion the previous year. They have also seen a 30% increase in net deposits, which supports my theory.

**Robinhood is Already Attempting to Implement Casual Financials to a Conservative Crowd, and in Other Words, are Trying to Appeal to Low-Risk Retail:** In Robinhood's 2022 roadmap, it states that it:

* Wants to Focus on Long-Term Investing
* Acquired Ziglu Limited to Spread to the European Financial and Coin Markets
* Attempts to dish out retirement accounts
* Launched Their Robinhood Debit Card

What does this mean? It means that, as I said earlier, Robinhood is trying to appeal to a more stable crowd when it comes to its service. Robinhood is trying to stay relevant to the users that previously traded high-risk securities on its platform. They also acquired Ziglu Limited in order to spread to the European market, I believe this may come with higher profits.

**Potential Profitability and Competitive Advantages:** Since Robinhood is trying to appeal to a more stable and financially savvy crowd, they will likely make more money for Robinhood. They will both spend more on stable securities and will be at lower risk of default, combined with their European expansion, they will have a better userbase that will stay longer. And as much as people seem to deny it, Robinhood is a commission-free brokerage. They have the reputation of ""democratizing finance""; which is going to sit well with more conservative retail investors, and if they manage to pull a 180 and turn over their reputation, they will see a massive influx.

Usually REITS correlate heavily with stocks. When stocks are down so are REITS.

Hi everyone. I would love a few eyes on this to get your thoughts on what you would consider best for my current situation. I'm going to be moving away from my current house (Property B) and am faced with selling it our renting it out. (This is South Florida- Palm Beach County) I'll give what I think is the relevant data and will be extremely grateful for those willing to offer their wisdom. Thanks so much for your time.

**Property A is a 3/1 SFH.** (Rented out. Great tenant.)

Current mortgage (PITI) is $1000. Rental income is $2200. After maintenance and income tax (which I estimate at $500 a month) my net is +$700.

Further: Currently owe $115,000 with 24 years left on an 5/1 ARM loan (still have 4 years left on loan before interest rate changes) that currently has a 3.09% rate. Could sale for $400,000 (a conservative estimate). Obviously, selling it would net me $285,000 (hardly any capital gains taxes since I lived in it 2 of the past 5 years).

**Property B is a 3/2 SFH with 2 offices**. (I am about to move out of this within a couple of months).

Current mortgage (PITI) is $1850. I spend $100 per month on maintenance. Rent would be $3300 per month if I decided to rent it out.

Further: I currently owe $275,000 with a 3.25% ***fixed*** rate. My realtor thinks that this could sell for $600,000. And I've lived her the past 2 years, so hardly any capital gains tax here either, giving me flexibility if I decide to sell one or the other.

Currently I'm leaning towards holding both as investments and renting them both out. Property management costs would be $0 per month as I would still be close enough to take care of everything. And I wouldn't be buying a new home, where I'm going with my job situation, lodging is taken care of. Thanks again for those of you willing to respond.

The prospect of faster-than-expected monetary tightening has rattled Wall Street, dragging the S&amp;P 500 deeper into bear territory Tuesday and forcing investors to reassess ***a stock market that doesn’t look cheap even after its dramatic selloff.***

It has been an ugly spell in markets, reflecting concerns about how the economy will hold up as the Federal Reserve embarks on its sharpest campaign of interest-rate increases in decades. Investors expect an increase of 0.75 percentage point on Wednesday, which would be the largest since 1994. 

Many investors contend that the worst in markets might soon be over, given the extended declines in many market sectors this year and the generally healthy state of the U.S. economy. They say buying the dip has fallen out of favor during this year’s rout but that negative sentiment is often a precursor to an extended rebound.

But ***even many optimists in the stock market concede that a rebound would have to contend with some significant obstacles, first and foremost the continued high level of valuations, which over time tend to be one of the strongest factors for predicting market performance.*** Even with the S&amp;P 500 down 22% in 2022, many investors and analysts fear that stock-market valuations have further to fall. The S&amp;P 500 traded Monday at 15.8 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet, still above the 15-year average of 15.7.

Raising rates Wednesday by a larger 0.75-percentage-point, or 75-basis-point, jump could be one way for the Fed to catch up to an increase in inflation that has been far higher and persistent than officials anticipated. Evidence that measures of inflation expectations by businesses and households over the long run are rising would be especially alarming inside the central bank.

“My sense is that the Fed has decided to do 75 basis points rather than 50 basis points because of the data we’ve gotten over the last week or so showing higher inflation and maybe some more disturbing news on inflation expectations,” former New York Fed President William Dudley said at The Wall Street Journal CFO Network event on Tuesday.

But he said he expected officials were “probably splitting the difference” by opting instead for the 0.75-percentage-point move.

Analysts who closely parse the central bank’s policies were divided Tuesday over whether the potential costs outweighed any benefits from shifting to a more aggressive 0.75-percentage-point rate rise from the half-point rate increase expected before the recent inflation reports.

Some warned that the central bank, by having recently provided unusually precise steers that it would raise rates by a half percentage point this week, risked sowing greater confusion in financial markets. Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, in a note to clients on Tuesday said he was worried that the 0.75-point rate increase “is not embedded in a credible and systematic policy strategy and, without this, risks looking like a panicky response…that may not age well.”

Mr. Guha, a former adviser at the New York Fed, said such a move created a “serious morning-after problem” by inviting difficult-to-answer questions about what the Fed would do next. 

***The Fed’s campaign to tame inflation is upending the dynamics that ruled the stock market in recent years, when rock-bottom interest rates drove investors to seek returns in risky assets. The popular view that there were no alternatives to stocks helped push the S&amp;P 500 ever higher, reaching a recent valuation peak in September 2020 of 24.1 times its projected earnings.***

More recently, ***worries about inflation and the path of interest-rate increases have provoked turmoil in markets as well as vigorous debate over the right valuations for stocks in the current environment.*** One source of concern is the risk that the Fed’s tightening will push the economy into a recession, damaging both business fundamentals and investor sentiment. More immediately, higher interest rates reduce the value of companies’ future cash flows in frequently used pricing models.

One concern for financial markets is that bond investors are beginning to anticipate not only a sharper path of increases, but a higher destination or so-called terminal rate for the Fed. On Tuesday, investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 89% probability that the Fed would lift rates to around 4% or higher by June 2023. That market-implied probability was at 1% four weeks ago, according to CME Group.

In periods of distress, investors can be quick to decide that stocks are worth much less. And historically, valuations have fallen farther before bottoming. In the selloff of December 2018, during the Fed’s most recent previous rate-raising cycle, the S&amp;P 500’s forward multiple fell as low as 13.8. In the depths of the March 2020 selloff, as the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic shut down swaths of the economy, the index traded as low as 13.4 times its projected earnings. 

***“Markets don’t typically bottom near historical medians,” said Greg Swenson, portfolio manager at Leuthold Group. “They tend to overshoot on the downside from a valuation perspective.”***

Adding to concerns for stock investors: ***Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.*** U.S. companies have warned of challenges on multiple fronts, from rising costs to a foreign-exchange hit from a stronger dollar.

***“Those valuation multiples are based on a really overly optimistic earnings outlook,” Mr. Swenson said.***

***Another valuation model, the Buffett Indicator, compares the value of publicly traded companies in the U.S. with the country’s gross national product. As of the end of last week, a version of that measure was 29% above its historical average and above its peak in the dot-com bubble days of 2000***, suggesting that the market is overvalued. The metric was named for Warren Buffett, who once called the indicator “probably the best single measure of where [stock market] valuations stand at any given moment.” 

Two recent surveys have shown signs that consumers’ long-term inflation expectations are rising. Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that such expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.

A couple notes:

1) ***For investors utilizing the passive strategy, none of this matters.***  The original plan was to DCA through thick and thin into the index, and none of this news alters that plan, at all.  Financial news like this is targeted towards people with an active component to their investment strategy.

2) One key theme in this article is that ***valuations matter***.  This time is no different. 
 Most bears over several years have been warning about this, but there has been no catalyst to spook the market until lately, that catalyst being persistent inflation.

3) ***Don't Fight the Fed***.  This should be self-evident by now to newer investors.

edit

4) An extra note.  One of the bolded quotes in the article:

&gt;Many have begun to worry that corporate profits are coming under threat, suggesting that valuation measures based on earnings projections could be understating how expensive stocks really are.

This is why CAPE is valuable.  CAPE does not go off earnings projections...it instead goes off historical earnings.  One in the hand is worth two in the bush.  ***According to CAPE, the market is still about as overvalued as it was in 1929.

t3_vcrbmr|1655288572.0|investing|A concept to earn an extra return on your investment from people who liquidate their investment prematurely|" 

Hi all,

So I thought of this concept where you get together as a kind of investment club and individually choose the investment size of an agreed upon investment (eg. S&amp;P500 Index) and individually choose an investment period. When you set these parameters, you may also determine a so called ""commitment rate"", which is a percentage of your investments size (anything between 0%-100%). The size of your ""commitment rate"" results in the ""commitment deposit""(investment size x commitment rate) and determines two things: 1. Your deposit to the commitment pool and 2. Your claim to the commitment pool (Your commitment deposit / Total commitment pool deposits).

Now, should someone else in this investment club prematurely withdraw his investment within his own set investment period, his commitment pool deposit will remain in the commitment pool and be distributed to the other investment club members according to their commitment pool claim.

If you stick to your investment period your commitment pool will be returned in full, including the gain of the asset itself during the investment period, plus commitment pool deposits of those who withdrew prematurely.

Bottom line, if you hold to your assets (which what we are clearly advised to do by oh so many people) you will be extra rewarded who panic or speculate and withdraw their funds.

What are your constructive thoughts?"|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|[]

* The meeting is set to take place at 11 a.m. Frankfurt time

*Carolynn Look*

&gt; The European Central Bank’s Governing Council will hold an unscheduled meeting to discuss the recent selloff in government bonds, which has grown in intensity after plans were announced to begin raising interest rates from record lows.
&gt; 
&gt; The rate-setting panel will convene on Wednesday “to discuss current market conditions,” according to an ECB spokesperson. The meeting will begin at 11am Frankfurt time, a person familiar with the matter said. A statement may follow.
&gt; 
&gt; The announcement comes after the yield on Italy’s 10-year debt rose above 4% for the first time since 2014 this week. Investors are so far unconvinced the ECB can raise borrowing costs to combat unprecedented euro-zone inflation while also keeping yields among the bloc’s most vulnerable members in check.
&gt; 
&gt; A possible 75 basis-point rate increase from the Federal Reserve later in the day could add to the jitters.
&gt; 
&gt; Italian yields fell back as much as 29 basis points to 3.89% at Wednesday’s open, while the euro rose as much as 0.6% to 1.0475 against the dollar and money markets pared bets on a half-point rate hike next month to 50%.
&gt; 
&gt; “The central bank needs to be concerned if investors cannot buy or sell bonds in secondary markets and issuers have to postpone funding,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank. “In contrast to earlier episodes of disorderly market movements, however, inflation makes the difference this time around. The ECB cannot simply pour money at the problem as monetary tightening and higher rates are actually needed.”
&gt; 
&gt; While government bonds have been jumpy for some time, the ECB has so far only allocated reinvestments from its pandemic asset-purchase program toward stabilizing what it considers unwarranted market turbulence.
&gt; 
&gt; Investors, meanwhile, have been on the lookout for an additional instrument to tackle so-called fragmentation, and there was some disappointment when officials didn’t unveil one at their policy meeting last week.
&gt; 
&gt; ### ‘No Limits’
&gt; 
&gt; While the Governing Council says it can quickly devise a new tool, it’s been reluctant to reveal details, convinced that there are few benefits in doing so and worried the markets may immediately try to test its limits.
&gt; 
&gt; Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel -- who’s in charge of the ECB’s market operations -- signaled Tuesday evening that any response to bond-market panic will come when it’s needed and will depend on the specific situation officials are faced with.
&gt; 
&gt; She did, however, pledge that the ECB won’t tolerate “changes in financing conditions that go beyond fundamental factors and that threaten monetary-policy transmission,” saying the commitment to stave off fragmentation “has no limits.”
&gt; 
&gt; Those remarks drew parallels to former ECB President Mario Draghi’s famous 2012 promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. Schnabel highlighted the ECB’s Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program and the OMT created under Draghi as examples of policy makers’ ability to respond to different kinds of market stress.
&gt; 
&gt; The bond storm comes with the ECB poised to end eight years of negative rates with a “sustained” cycle of hikes planned from July and including a likely half-point move in September. It plans to end net purchases under a long-standing bond-buying program at the start of next month.
&gt; 
&gt; Several Governing Council members were due to speak on Wednesday. Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel’s remarks at 11:15 a.m. in Milan have been cancelled, as have Bank of Spain chief Pablo Hernandez de Cos’s at 2:30 p.m.
&gt; 
&gt; Wednesday’s ad hoc meeting was first reported by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

Because of this I wanted to give the below example portfolio portraying how to use a LETF because I agree with the majority that going 100% into a LETF is not typically a good idea. 

Anyways, consider someone who is currently 100% S&amp;P but would like to increase their exposure to 120%. To do this they could allocate 90% to the S&amp;P and the other 10% to UPRO (3x S&amp;P ETF). Initially when the trades are made, this person will have 120% exposure. However, as the market moves this exposure will move as well. When the market is down, their exposure will fall as UPRO will fall 3x more than the S&amp;P and vice versa on the upside. What this shows is that although UPRO’s leverage is reset daily, the portfolio leverage is not; the portfolio’s leverage will adjust with the market. This portfolio can then be rebalanced back to target based on a calendar rebalancing or a rebalancing range. 

Thus, assuming UPRO can continue to earn 3x daily returns as it has in the past, this is a decent way to increase exposure while limiting some of the downsides of LETFs. One must keep in mind though that over the long term the return will likely be less than 1.2x the S&amp;P due to UPRO’s fees.

Since 2009 when UPRO was created, this portfolio has earned 15.2% annually compared to the S&amp;P’s 13.25. This comes out to about 1.147x the S&amp;P. Since 1993, this portfolio has earned 10.93% compared to the S&amp;P’s 9.97%. This comes out to 1.096x the S&amp;P. As you can see, you won’t consistently get 1.2x exposure over the LT but if your goal is to increase exposure a bit this is definitely a possibility with LETFs."|0.93|31.0|0.0|31.0|['LETFs', 'UPRO']

A commodity's spot price trading *~~lower~~* **higher** than some given future contract is, in cases, normal (e.g. seasonality or perishable commodities). The backwardation we are seeing today is extreme by any standards. 

***[Sorry, typo. Backwardation is spot &gt; future. Although this was clarified in the following sentence, the above typo may have confused some people.]***

Physical commodities have a cost of carry that include risk premium, accounting costs, storage. For commodities like oil, this cost of carry adds a certain dollar amount to the cost of a barrel. WTI Crude today trades at a 10+% discount six months out from now. The discount 12 months out is nearly 20%. 

* **Breakeven Inflation**

Markets are pricing in an average inflation much lower than 3% over the following ten years. This is not much further off from rates we were seeing in late 2021. The average 10y breakeven for Q4 2021 was 2.53% vs 2.74% today. 

* **US Dollar Index**

Most world currencies are tanking, resulting in strong US Dollar performance. Paradigms can shift, so this may become old knowledge, but the past decade has shown that a strong US Dollar results in dollar scarcity and deflationary tendencies. Could a more compartmentalized global economy change this? It is possible although fully theoretical.

Nick Timiraos

&gt; A string of [troubling inflation reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-economy-federal-reserve-11655134682?mod=article_inline) in recent days is likely to lead Federal Reserve officials to consider surprising markets with a larger-than-expected 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase at their meeting this week.
&gt; 
&gt; Before officials began their premeeting quiet period on June 4, they had signaled they were prepared to raise interest rates by a half percentage point this week and again at their meeting in July. But they also had said their outlook depended on the economy evolving as they expected. [Last week’s inflation report](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-may-2022-11654810079?mod=article_inline) from the Labor Department showed a bigger jump in prices in May than officials had anticipated.
&gt; 
&gt; Two consumer surveys have also shown households’ expectations of future inflation have increased in recent days. That data could alarm Fed officials because they believe such expectations can be self-fulfilling.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed raised rates by a half percentage point at [its meeting last month](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-approves-half-point-interest-rate-rise-ratcheting-up-its-inflation-fight-11651687201?mod=article_inline), the first such increase since 2000, to a range between 0.75% and 1%. The Fed last raised rates by 0.75 percentage point at a meeting in 1994, when the central bank was rapidly raising rates to pre-empt a potential rise in inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has avoided surprising markets on the day of policy meetings, instead arguing that the central bank can achieve its goals of tightening policy by shaping market expectations.
&gt; 
&gt; But he also said in an interview last month that the Fed would be guided by the economic data to come. “What we need to see is clear and convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating and inflation is coming down. And if we don’t see that, then we’ll have to consider moving more aggressively,” Mr. Powell said.
&gt; 
&gt; At [a news conference](https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-fed-chief-powells-postmeeting-press-conference-11651696613?mod=article_inline) last month, Mr. Powell said the central bank would “strive to avoid adding uncertainty” but also acknowledged the possibility of “further surprises” in the inflation data. “We therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The Labor Department reported Friday that its consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May from the same month a year earlier, pushing inflation to a 40-year high. That was a setback for forecasters who were looking for signs that inflation had peaked in March. Rising fuel prices and supply-chain disruptions from Russia’s war against Ukraine have sent prices up in recent months.
&gt; 
&gt; A handful of Wall Street forecasters, including at investment banks Barclays and Jefferies, said Friday, after the inflation data were released, that they expected the Fed to raise rates by 0.75 percentage point this week.
&gt; 
&gt; “We believe that risk-management considerations call for aggressive action to reinforce the Fed’s inflation-fighting credibility,” Barclays economists wrote in a subsequent report Monday. While such a move “would go against communications leading into the blackout period,” the report said “risks of prolonged inflation have intensified,” justifying the larger rate rise.
&gt; 
&gt; After the publication of this article on Monday afternoon, other forecasters, including at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said they expected a 0.75-percentage-point rate rise this week.
&gt; 
&gt; On Friday, a University of Michigan survey of consumers’ long-term inflation expectations rose to its highest level since 2008. On Monday, the New York Fed reported that its survey showed consumers’ short-term inflation expectations had jumped and that the distribution of households’ longer-term expectations was more varied than in the past, suggesting more households might be expecting higher inflation to stay, even though the median didn’t rise.
&gt; 
&gt; Fed officials have said they would want to respond aggressively to signs that inflation expectations were rising, or becoming “de-anchored,” because they believe the process of wringing inflation from the economy will become far more difficult if that has happened.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a one-two punch,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “They’ve got to go now with 75. The Fed is behind the curve, and they know it.”
&gt; 
&gt; Bond yields, which surged Friday amid a broad market selloff, continued to climb as [that rout deepened on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-fears-send-u-s-bond-yields-surging-ahead-of-fed-meeting-11655135691?mod=article_inline). Investors in interest-rate futures markets placed a nearly 30% probability on the larger 0.75-percentage-point increase on Monday afternoon, up from around 4% before last Friday’s inflation reports, according to CME Group. After publication of this article, those market-implied probabilities rose above 90%.
&gt; Consumers’ inflation expectations for both the short and long term are on the upswing, according to surveys.
&gt; 
&gt; Officials will have to weigh several considerations at their two-day meeting that begins on Tuesday. They could stick with their current strategy of raising rates in half-percentage-point increments indefinitely until they see signs that inflation is conclusively downshifting.
&gt; 
&gt; Such a path of rate rises would lift the Fed’s overnight benchmark rate to a range between 2.25% and 2.5% by September, and to a range between 3.25% and 3.5% by December. This would represent the most aggressive interval of policy tightening since the 1980s.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, Mr. Powell and his colleagues could signal a rising likelihood of shifting to larger rate rises at the Fed’s meeting in late July.
&gt; 
&gt; But if officials anticipate a significant likelihood of such an increase at the July 26-27 meeting, they could decide to move more aggressively this week.
&gt; 
&gt; Ms. Swonk said she expected officials to make such an argument at this week’s meeting. “The data now is not good. The data is saying they have to do more,” said Ms. Swonk. “We’re moving into a more inflation-prone world, and they know that, and if they don’t derail it now, this could be incredibly corrosive.”
&gt; 
&gt; Already, borrowing costs set by markets have climbed faster than the Fed’s benchmark rate in anticipation of its policy moves. Mortgage lenders on Monday said they were beginning to quote a 30-year fixed loan with rates above 6%, levels that haven’t been reached since 2008.
&gt; 
&gt; Other analysts said Monday afternoon that a larger 0.75-point rate jump would cause more problems for the central bank than it would solve by confusing investors about how the Fed reacts to new data.
&gt; 
&gt; “It just opens up additional communication challenges thereafter,” said Neil Dutta, an economist at research firm Renaissance Macro. “It suggests the Fed is losing confidence in its forecast. We all know they were trying to catch up, but now it looks like they are panicking.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Dutta said he also worried that a supersize rate increase would make it harder for the central bank to avoid a recession. “It suggests the Fed is willing to push the economy into a ‘hard-landing’-like scenario to get inflation under control,” he said.

The more often you look at your portfolio, the more likely you are to make a mistake. 

So I’m thinking once a year for re-balancing?

Mind you, ideally you want the re-balancing to be as tax-efficient as possible…

Also, when do you decide to increase and decrease exposure of an asset class? Seems like it’s market timing more than anything tbh…

Take gold for instance, do you increase exposure from 5 to 10% before high inflation? How do you know though it’s coming (before it happened I’m talking about I know it’s here lol)?

Further, when do you know that it’s time to cut back on that asset allocation? When inflation goes back down obviously, but you only know that *after* the fact and by that point gold price would already be factored in…

t3_vbndxc|1655156843.0|investing|Opinion: Growth stocks make just as much sense as Value stocks right now|"Firstly, when I refer to Growth vs Value, let’s assume I mean the holdings of VUG vs those of VTV. 

Anyway, after spending a couple of hours per day for the last couple of months reading up on the macro economic environment and trying to gauge where things are heading, I have come to the conclusion… It a futile exercise. It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. 

Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. 

From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. 

Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. 

I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&amp;P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&amp;P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. 

Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. 

Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. 

My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. 

On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount.

The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now.  It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. 

TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks.

This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this."|0.82|72.0|0.0|72.0|['Microsoft', 'holdings - Apple', 'ATH', 'Value', 'Tesla', 'Amazon', 'VOO', 'VTV', 'Meta', 'Visa', 'Home Depot']

The $2,000 will be in my brokerage account and I will invest it in one lump sum into index funds if the market REALLY dips. I will continue my same dollar cost averaging into index funds every month I’ll just have $2,000 less in my checking account and $2,000 in cash in my brokerage account(unless I invest that). 

Once the market recovers/stabilizes I’ll increase the minimum amount in my checking account by 2,000 and if I did not invest the 2,000 in my brokerage account I’ll transfer it back to my checking. If I do invest the extra 2,000 then I won’t sell the index funds I’ll just save up 2,000 real quick and add that to my checking account.

Edit 2: Yesterday I transferred $2,000 out of my checking account and into my brokerage and bought two VOO at $343.79. The rest of my $1,300 is in cash in my brokerage account waiting for it to drop lower. I realize these numbers are small and aren’t sexy but I’m only 23 and just started on my career."|0.92|327.0|0.0|327.0|['VOO']

t3_vax59e|1655072741.0|investing|Stagflation was about energy price, not monetary policy.|"Before you read any of my words, [look closely at this graph](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart). Note that it is in today’s prices (e.g. adjusted for inflation). Before even looking at the 1970’s, look at the 50’s and 60’s. Each decade brought new incremental lows to the price of oil, and society was designed around the premise of cheap oil, from travel to manufacturing to home heating. Little effort was made on efficiency, because for almost 3 decades oil got progressively cheaper each year. Like a Thanksgiving turkey, the American economy loved the farmer that fed it from December to November.

Now we come to stagflation. Oil went from $28 a barrel in December 1973 to  $63 in January of 1974 - just a month later. The historical high price of oil was $32 in 1948. To put this in modern terms, it would be like oil hitting $300 a barrel by mid-July from $120 now. This energy shock is what caused the twin pillagers of economic stagnation (they laid me off!) and inflation (it costs me how much to fill up my tank?). The problem was not bad monetary policy in 1973. I mean, it might have been bad, but  it didn’t matter much at all compared to the overnight explosion of prices in the necessary commodity that underpinned the global economy, from food to airplanes. I really must emphasize the food point, without tractors and gas we can’t feed 98% of the world with only 2% working the fields. Minus fossil fuels, that ratio flips - you need 98% of the population farming to feed the lucky 2% who can have a different job. That’s what made the medieval era different. 

Why did oil skyrocket like that? [Because America’s support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to the OPEC oil embargo](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/oil-shock-of-1973-74). As we are learning now, if an oil cartel decides to pick a side in a war, they can take a pound of flesh. Though Russia is only a fraction as dominant now as OPEC was then. 

I’ve seen folks debating whether Volker’s deflationary and merciless interest rate hikes helped lower demand enough. I’ve seen folks suggest Reagan’s inflationary and optimistic tax cuts somehow voodooed the economic back into shape. Both are efforts to paint the target on top of the bullet holes already in the wall. Oil peaked in May of 1980 and dropped off a cliff in January 1986*. The reason for that collapse? [Saudi Arabia wanted to take more market share and increased production](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1986/06/1986b_bpea_gately_adelman_griffin.pdf). The lesson of stagflation isn’t some cautionary tale about monetary policy. It’s about the price of energy, full stop. Preventing Volker or Reagan had anything to do with it more than on the margins is just an exercise in comfort - it’s nice to think that we can choose leaders who might fix something. In reality they are all riding the same elephant, and they aren’t the ones telling it what to do. Some, however, do a better job of convincing others that they are in charge. 

The one thing we could (and did) meaningfully do that was in our control was reduce waste - double pane windows to keep heat inside in winter, smarter manufacturing processes, more fuel efficient cares, etc. The decline in price from 1980 to 1986 was the product of getting smarter about energy use. Saudi Arabia just saw the writing on the wall and decided to grab market share while it could. It was in their interest to encourage uncritical oil consumption long term. 

Any news article or comment you see that brings up the dreaded specter of stagflation had better provide a reason for why we change-point jump into a new energy pricing regime, because that’s what it takes. Be as pessimistic or optimistic as you’re intuition allows about what’s coming, but it’s important to know the history of stagflation given how much it’s coming up. And that history is basically: you are in less control than you think you are. 

Now, with all that in mind, scroll down to the [third graph on this page](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth). This (long term, not short term) is the most important thing happening right now, just like the OPEC embargo was the most important thing happening during stagflation. The cheaper energy is, the less we have to think about it, and the more we can think about computers, social networks, graphics cards, AI, EVs, etc. The fun economy starts after the “eat your vegetables” economy of energy price ends. 

*It’s not a coincidence that the Soviet Union collapsed a few years after the oil price collapse. Russia then, as today, had an economy dependent on fossil fuel exports.

Before anyone replies to this by saying “hahahah silly that would never happen, we have insurance now!” bank insurance is not full coverage.

I’m looking for a discussion more so about the economic side of things, like is it even *economically* possible?

Let me explain what I mean, in Lebanon for instance where I have relatives from, the banks imposed capital controls.

The reason for which was because everyone for whatever reason started pulling out their US dollars in cash from the bank.

The banks, operating on fractional reserve, did not have enough US dollars to meet the demand from depositors asking for their money back.

In order to prevent a run, they have imposed a bank freeze so you can’t pull any money out in order to prevent a run on banks. It’s been like that for years to this day.

Now, in *ordinary* circumstances, the central bank can simply step in and inject in theory as much liquidity as needed. However, because other countries like Lebanon don’t have the power to print US dollars like the US does, they’re stuck.

So, *here lies my question*, in the *worst case scenario* is it even possible economically speaking for there to be a bank freeze?

Initially I thought no, but then I realized there’s only so much money they can keep printing to meet depositors demand before inflation racks up.

Better yet, take for instance the present, we already *have* high inflation, so wouldn’t that mean central bank is limited in how much it can print now.

Say people start pulling out their money now, banks get a bail out, people soon after pull out again when inflation remains high and central bank refuses a bail.

Is there ever a scenario where there’s a bank freeze?

If so, how would that work? How would the economy function? Barter?

Let me expand, say we hike inflation cools, then there's another recession prompting a cut in rates into negative territory. Yes I know other countries have done this, but I'm talking a little more, like bottom bottom bottom of the negative pit to the point where any further and banks would lose money lending out at that rate so it's in real terms the bottom.

Say in that case they gradually start hiking up but after first hike, there's another huge multi-factor catalyst causing another recession and the central bank wants to lower again.

*However,* because it's so low in negative territory already, they simply cannot go lower; well they could go back down to before that one hike they did, so assume they want back down one bump, *then what*.

Let me summarize my question:

**What happens when the central bank has gone into negative interest rates so low - some countries are negative already, but there's a tiny bit more space I've ready in theory they could go down so this is a scenario where they're essentially there - but it's not enough to act as a cushion that prevents said recession.

t3_vae7mh|1655007988.0|investing|An article posted yesterday on the MBS market|"Michael Burry posted a link to this article in a tweet but I think it's worth reposting here (it's worth noting he didn't write the article but merely linked to it in his tweet)


&gt; During the last forty-four years, my days have begun and ended with the mortgage market. Four painful moments stand out. Today makes five. (There have been many more good days, but even the Fairy Godmother has her limits.)
&gt; 
&gt; Mortgages are covered poorly in financial press, as stocks and such are much more entertaining. Today’s events still unfolding will take days for good coverage. Freddie’s weekly survey will not discover today until next Thursday. But the MBS market is real-time, not like old, sleepy S&amp;L days.
&gt; 
&gt; The CPI news this morning was so awful that it changed the bond market’s view of Fed trajectory, and the weakest sector broke. In bond jargon, MBS went “no-bid.” No buyers for MBS. Then a few posted prices beyond borrower demand, not wanting to buy except at penalty prices. Overnight the retail consequence has been a leap from roughly 5.50% to 6.00% for low-fee 30-fixed loans.
&gt; 
&gt; The physics of collisions... the second one does the harm. When your car hits a telephone pole, no problem. Then, after a slight lag, trouble comes when you hit the inside of your car. Same thing in football: helmet on helmet is all-okay... until your brain hits the inside of your skull.
&gt; The same physics govern housing collisions with mortgages. At the new year mortgages were still three-ish. In February, four. At the end of March, five. May, five-and-a-half. Historically, a two-percentage-point rise from cyclical trough has iced housing, the freeze underway a month ago. Now up by three points, and _double_ January.
&gt; 
&gt; The pause in housing between the first collision and second is elongated because of human nature. Someone desperate to buy a house is still desperate, and modestly relieved to buy even at a higher price and rate so long as not forced into an unlimited auction. Now it’s time for Wile E. Coyote in his Acme sneakers, running off into thin air and all okay until he looks down.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking down... MBS are such a weird market that other markets have not processed what is happening. Stocks are down 2% today, but would be down a hell of a lot more if considering what a full-stop to housing will mean.
&gt; 
&gt; Another marker of MBS distress: the 10-year T-note had held 3.00% since April, the important top in 2012 and 2018. Trading 3.05% yesterday, now 3.20% -- retail mortgages jumped *triple* that amount. The 10s/mortgages spread today is almost 300bps and double the 10s’ yield. Inconceivable. The Fed telltale 2-year T-note had held 2.70% since April, 2.85% yesterday, today 3.05% adding only one more .25% hike to the 2-cast, which is not enough to explain MBS overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; **Today’s CPI Trigger.** Markets were braced for a bad report, but not this. Overall CPI jumped 1.0% in May. Any thought of deceleration... ka-blooie. CPI 8.6% in the last year, accelerating under pressure from Ukraine energy dislocation.
&gt; 
&gt; Many observers this morning say that the CPI news is so lousy that there is no point in looking at the details. Wrong. From the onset of Covid to Ukraine, our inflation problem was supply chain, mostly manufactured goods. Since Ukraine, it has shifted to energy.
&gt; 
&gt; Different elements of CPI have different weightings, which conceal the effect of energy in a crisis like this. In May the energy index within CPI... up 34.6% in May alone. In an event like this, the notion of excluding the high-volatility “core” is meaningless.   
&gt; *Everything* requires energy. The uppers and soles of your Nikes are fossil fuel. Food has its own Ukraine issue, but energy is the problem, from fuel to fertilizer.
&gt; 
&gt; Oil was $75/bbl pre-Ukraine, then held just above $100, now $120. Natural gas from normal $4-$5/mbtu... since Ukraine $9. The May increase in fuel oil, $16.9%. May utility natural gas, up 8% in the month. You can see component-by-component, month-by-month CPI here [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) Table A.
&gt; 
&gt; **Those Other Four Moments...**
&gt; 
&gt; 1. 1979, Saturday of Columbus Day Weekend, Paul Volcker announced that the Fed would allow the cost of money to float as high as necessary. Mortgages 11% on Friday, on Tuesday after the holiday 13%. However! That was 15 years into entrenched inflation, oil ten times as expensive in 1979 as 1972, and our economy just beginning energy conservation and new supply. All incomes ramped right along with inflation. The US economy was a “things” economy, with little overseas competition for union-heavy US labor.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. 1994, February... the cost of money coming out of recession 1.00%, by year-end 1994 to 5.25% -- but in a disinflationary world, the cost of money was one-half the cycle peak four years before. 1994, February to May, mortgages from 7% to 9% -- that magic two-point rise flattened housing, and the Fed had to cut in 1995 to dodge recession. The new mortgage peak, stabilizing near 8% was down from 11% in 1990, and we enjoyed a genuine and rare soft landing.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. 2007, July... you had to be deep in the mortgage racket to understand the first collision. Subprime and Jumbos went no-bid, and stayed there. The Fed was slow to understand the credit panic, began frantic cuts the following winter from 5.25% to 2.00%. But mortgages did not respond, stuck above 6.00%.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. 2008, July... the no-bid expanded to all mortgages, even government guaranteed. The 10-year T-note anticipating recession and worse fell to 3.50% while retail mortgages rose to 7.00%. That 350bps spread is the closest comparable to today’s 300bps.
&gt; 
&gt; **Now What.** At Thanksgiving 2008 the credit markets (all markets) were rescued by Ben Bernanke’s genius, announcing quantitative easing -- buying enough MBS and Treasurys to unlock markets in which all had been afraid to buy.
&gt; 
&gt; Today... is it a coincidence that MBS have blown simultaneously with the Fed’s flip from QE buying to allowing runoff and threatening to sell? The weak break first. MBS are weird, and weird under stress is weak.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fed has had a plan, Powell becoming more concise each day: We will raise the cost of money until inflation comes under control. “It is our job to calibrate demand to supply.” A good, tidy, sorta mathematic way to proceed. But destruction of demand has limits, and this morning we hit one.
&gt; 
&gt; In today’s US, nobody is prepared to deal with inflation as it has developed in the last 90 days. Inflation can drop and even stabilize above the Fed’s target, but the world is only three months into finding alternate energy for Europe’s oil and gas imports from Russia. Including natural gas, something like 15% of the world’s energy supply has been dislocated.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps half will quickly be redirected. India and China are buying at a deep discount from Vladimir, which makes available much of the supply which those two used to buy elsewhere, Europe lining up. But Russian production is already suffering, a net and permanent loss. Alternate supplies require alternate delivery, gas especially tough -- absent pipelines, all gas deliveries are dependent on scarce LNG ships and terminals. Coal normal, $50-$100/ton... today $395.
&gt; 
&gt; In this circumstance, the Fed’s demand destruction has all the wisdom of Xi’s zero-covid. In a rational world, if the party in power in DC were not encumbered by climateers, we would turn on the hose, take every step to unimpede production and delivery. Instead of threatening to tax windfall profits, we would offer incentive price guarantees to protect producers from the energy price drop certain to lie ahead. This is an energy problem, not some amorphous inflation amoeba.
&gt; 
&gt; Below the 10-year T-note in the last twenty years. In 2018 there were a few days with trades above 3.20%, so in theory 10s have not broken that critical support. Theories like that tend to last a few days. The Fed has to decide how much destruction it has in mind.

Say rising inflation forces the governments hand to impose price controls and rationing like they did during wartime economy and to a lesser extent Nixon era - they realize the central bank is limited in how much it can tame supply side inflation with rate hikes, plus the government accepts they don't want them to take it that far considering household debt is at a record high - which investment strategy performed best during this time?

Bonds?

t3_va4x5l|1654976399.0|investing|Optimal I Bond Strategies|"I remember a couple months ago on this sub how novel it was to see any bond yielding 7%, let alone a risk free inflation protected bond like the I Bond.

Now, they are yielding above 9%.  Both [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/janet-yellens-half-hearted-apology-wont-save-the-us-economy/) have admitted that they got inflation wrong by calling it transitory.  Bottom line, looks like high rates on I Bonds are here to stay for a while.

Given that formerly conventional fixed income strategies like laddered CDs and government bond funds are still yielding extremely sub par amounts, this creates an opening for I Bonds, excepting the $10k limit, to be a go-to instrument for a myriad number of circumstances:

* Inflation protection 
* Saving for a down payment on a house
* Fixed income securities for those in retirement
* Playing the spread, i.e. getting XYZ debt for, say, 5% and putting the proceeds into I Bonds yielding over 9% (the logic is the same as incurring low rate debt to put in the market)
* Other short term investments
* Safe Haven for active investment strategies
* etc etc

The limiting factor is the $10k annual limit.  People have been coming up with methods to circumvent this limit, the logic (not the method) being similar to coming up with methods to circumvent the limits for Roth IRAs.  The latter is considered legal and legitimate.  Shouldn't the former also be considered so as well?  If so, shouldn't it be exploited for the incredible results such strategies would yield compared to currently available options?

Two methods I've seen so far:

[Revocable Living Trusts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ulcvj9/setting_up_revocable_living_trusts_for_the/)

[Limited Liability Corporations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v75mv0/can_you_avoid_ibond_limits_with_llcs/)

For those reading the financial news, there have been a lot of comparisons made between markets today and that of the 70s, when inflation was high and returns in the stock market were negative for over a decade.  If other fixed income instruments continue to provide not only zero protection but rather a vulnerability to prolonged inflation, I Bonds become part of an optimal strategy for wealth preservation.

The main downside for I Bonds is that they provide zero real return, and after taxes may actually result in negative real returns.  However, compared to the myriad options in the market today yielding extreme negative real returns (like HYSAs yielding -8% real returns), I Bonds still look great.

Do you agree that I Bonds sans the $10k limit are an optimal investment vehicle for many situations?  Do you agree that exploring options to circumvent the limit are valid?  If so, what other methods do you know can circumvent the $10k limit?

---

edit -  Looking over the comments, it's clear that a lot of people do not understand the term ""real return"" or what it has to do with inflation and I Bonds.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realrateofreturn.asp

1) I bonds track inflation.  I bonds yield 9.62%.  This is a nominal rate of return.

2) Inflation per the CPI calculation I bonds use is 9.62%.

3) 9.62 - 9.62 = 0% real return.

4) Your nominal interest, i.e. 9.62%, is taxed at the federal level.

5) 0% real return - your taxes on interest = negative real return.

A lot of people posting here do not understand that while 9.62% looks great, it is a nominal return.  Accounting for inflation, it provides a zero real return, and after taxes, you actually get a negative real return with I bonds.  Still better than most other investments out there, but it pays to know that you're still losing with this investment, and that in the long run it is not a viable replacement for investments designed to provide a real rate of return over time.

Screaming at the top of your lungs that you don't understand the above is not conducive to a sound investment strategy."|0.67|13.0|0.0|13.0|['Fed', 'Safe Haven', 'Treasury', 'Revocable Living Trusts](https://www.reddit.com']

## Business / Developments

Crocs main business is related to it’s famous clogs, while it tries to expand it’s brand in the sandals market. Additionally it makes money from the personalization options via Jibbitz, which according to the company achieves higher engagement and buying frequency for the products family as a whole supported by strong licenses like Disney brands.

**Growth**

To increase growth Crocs focuses on:

* increasing digital sales
* expanding in the sandals market
* growth in Asia

**Growth in Asia**

2/3 of all store openings were made in Asia with most of them in China. Over a quarter of all stores are based in Korea which is suprising at first and indicates a strong presence of the brand. Still most revenue growth was achieved in the Americas and EMEA, which doesn’t fit the companies aim to drive growth with Asia.

## HEYDUDE Acquisition

In it’s most recent quarterly report Crocs explained the acquisition of the HEYDUDE shoe brand on Febuary 17 2022. With a purchase price of $2.3 billion and additional expenses, it is Crocs first relevant acquisition and has been financed with $450 million in stock and over $2 billion in borrowings. The borrowing compromises mostly of an entry in the Term Loan B Facility with an interest rate equal to the SOFR plus additional 3.5% resulting in around 4% at the moment. With $115 million in revenue and $16 million this **quarter** the acquisition has a P/S of over 5 and a P/E of 39, which doesn’t really make it a bargain. Crocs stated it sees potential for HEYDUDE to reach 1 billion dollars in sales by 2024, which was the main reason for it’s purchase. With HEYDUDE already achieving high profits in it’s growth phase, large increases in it’s revenue would have a large impact on Crocs bottom line. We still have to take those estimates with a grain of salt, as almost no information is available. They state a guidance for around $800 million dollars for this year alone, which we will use in one of our DCF models.

|EMEA|241,948|243,660|356,157|

Table 1: Segment Revenues

Even though Crocs tries to focus it’s expansion efforts on Asia, the large part of it’s existing revenue

and growth came from the Americas (mostly USA).

||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|

|Operating Profit Margin|Loss|Loss|5,8%|10,5%|15,4%|29,5%|

Table 2: Sales and Profitablility

Looking at this table it almost speaks for itself. Crocs has increased it’s prices by 25% and has experienced a suprising large increase in units sold. It’s operating margin has developed from a loss to almost 30%. Most of it can be attributed to a recent hype for Crocs shoes with lots of attention coming from the hypebeast community. We will search for more answers on the development of the operating margin, by looking at the cost structure.

## Cost Structure (before HEYDUDE acquisition)

||2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Cost of sales|51,7%|49,5%|48,5%|49,9%|45,9%|38,6%|
|SGA|48,6%|48,3%|45,5%|39,7%|37,1%|31,9%|
|Operating Margin|\-0,6%|1,7%|5,8%|10,5%|15,4%|29,5%|

Table 3: Costs as a percentage of revenue

Over the years Crocs SGA expenses have hovered around the $500 million mark, while it decreased relative to revenues, when revenues finally picked up pace in 2019. The cost of sales always trailed revenue, but as the average price per unit increased by 12% from 2019-2020 the realtive cost of sales decreased by 8%. Similar developments occured, when Crocs raised it’s average price per unit by another 12% the cost of sales portion shrunk by another 15%. This development and it’s significant increase in pure unit sales allowed Crocs to develop from barely profitable into a cash-cow.

## Industry Comparison

|Company|Operating Margin|Cost of sales|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Nike|15%|55%|
|Deckers|20%|46%|
|Sketchers|9,5%|51%|
|Adidas|9,4%|49,3%|

Their unique product gives Crocs a competitive advantage, which has finally shown in 2020 and 2021. They top most big player in the footwear business in terms of operating margin as they were able to raise their prices significantly, which the highly competitive “normal” manufacturers weren’t able to do.

## Balance Sheet

With the Acquisition of HEYDUDE, Crocs balance sheet has doubled in size.

The most relevant changes of the last quarter included:

* Assets
   * Addition of $640 million in Goodwill
   * Addition of $1,88 billion in Intangibles
   * Doubling in inventory size ($213 million → $407 million), which isn’t concerning as most of the increase was due to the acquisition
* Liabilities
   * Addition of $2 billion in Long-term borrowings
   * Addition of $329 million in Long-term deferred tax liabilities

## Treasury Stock

Crocs has bought back 47,7 million shares which lie in the books at a value of around $1,7 billion dollars, which gives them an average cost basis of around $35 per share. This gives them very nice protection against a hostile takeover and the ability to raise good amounts of cash if needed.

## Debt Level

At a debt level of $2,8 billion Crocs interest expense amounts for $20 million per quarter. Looking at their Income, it’s safe to say that it won’t have much trouble with it’s debt. The management also announced in the investor presentation that one of it’s financial efforts will be a quick deleveraging.

## Cashflow Statement

## Share based compensation

Share based compensation has amounted for $8,2 million dollar or around 10% of net income in the first quarter. On an annual basis this amounts for around 1% of the total market cap at the price. This isn’t alarming in my opinion.

## CapEx and Depreciation&amp;Amortization

|As a percentage of revenue|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|D&amp;A|3,3%|3,2%|2,7%|2,0%|2,0%|1,4%|
|CapEx|1,2%|1,3%|2,0%|3,0%|3,0%|2,4%|

CapEx hovered between 1-3% of revenue, which is good news for a manufacturing company. They increased their CapEx fivefold, which indicated new investments to meet higher demand for their products. The HEYDUDE acquisition won’t increase amortization as most of the purchased intangible assets consist of trademarks and workforce, which can’t be tax deducted.

## Share Buybacks

Share buybacks have been excessive in the past year, even though they have been made at a high price per share of $120 which is not appealing at all, but was due too the sky high prices of up to $180 in November. In the future further share repurchases are paused until the deleveraging has reached it’s target, which as stated in the report won’t happen in 2022.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Since the share price dropped under $90 there has been some small and big purchases by the upper management. During the skyrocketing, there have been significant sales as the price began to climb above $50. We will keep that in mind for later.

## Analyst coverage / Institutional Ownership

There are 11 analysts (5) covering the stock (for comparision Amazon: 38), which is quite high and a negative. The institutional ownership is also high with 80% (4). Not a sign that a company is under the radar.

## Risks

* Decreasing hype for their product
* Flop of HEYDUDE acquisition
* Price decreases destroying their operating margin
* No real market evaluation possible as Crocs is a unique product → no certainty the market will grow
* Competitiors meeting their quality standards, thus stealing market share
* Not gaining a foothold in China
* Not gaining a foothold in the sandal industry

## DCF

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* By the managements guidance from investor presentation (3)
   * $750-$800 million dollars in revenue for HEYDUDE in 2022
   * Operating margin of 26%+ long term for Crocs (2026Estimate) and 26%+ for HEYDUDE in 2024E
   * Crocs revenue growth of 17% / HEYDUDE 20%+
   * CapEx: 3% of revenue
* Our assumptions
   * SGA Expenses and cost of sales have increases sharply. We will still take the resulting 18% operating margin at face value for our base case (15% bear case, 20% best case)

Inflation accelerated further in May, with prices rising 8.6% from a  year ago for the fastest increase since December 1981, the Bureau of  Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The consumer price index, a  wide-ranging measure of goods and services prices, increased even more  than the 8.3% Dow Jones estimate. Excluding volatile food and energy  prices, so-called core CPI was up 6%, slightly higher than the 5.9%  estimate.

On a monthly basis, headline CPI was up 1% while core rose 0.6%, compared to respective estimates of 0.7% and 0.5%.

Surging shelter, gasoline and food prices all contributed to the increase.

Energy  prices broadly rose 3.9% from a month ago, bringing the annual gain to  34.6%. Within the category, fuel oil posted a 16.9% monthly gain,  pushing the 12-month surge to 106.7%.

Shelter costs, which account  for about a one-third weighting on the CPI, rose 0.6% for the month,  the fastest one-month gain since March 2004. The 5.5% 12-month gain is  the most since February 1991.

Finally, food costs climbed another 1.2% in May, bringing the year-over-year gain to 10.1%.

Those  escalating prices meant workers took another pay cut during the month.  Real wages when accounting for inflation fell 0.6% in April, even though  average hourly earnings rose 0.3%. On a 12-month basis, real average  hourly earnings were down 3%.

Markets reacted negatively to the  report, with stock futures indicating a sharply lower open on Wall  Street and government bond yields rising.

Some of the biggest increases came in airfares (up 12.6% on the month), used cars and trucks (1.8%), and dairy products (2.9%).

Friday’s numbers dented hopes that inflation may have peaked and adds to fears that the U.S. economy is nearing a recession.

The  inflation report comes with the Federal Reserve in the early stages of a  rate-hiking campaign to slow growth and bring down prices. May’s report  likely solidifies the likelihood of multiple 50 basis point interest  rate increases ahead.

“Obviously, nothing is good in this report,”  said Julian Bridgen, president of MI2 Partners, a global macroeconomic  research firm. “There is nothing in there that’s going to give the Fed  any cheer. ... I struggle to see how the Fed can back off.”

With  75 basis points of interest rate rises already under its belt, markets  widely expect the Fed to continue tightening policy through the year and  possibly into 2023. The central bank’s benchmark short-term borrowing  rate is currently anchored around 0.75% -1% and is expected to rise to  2.75%-3% by the end of the year, according to CME Group estimates.

Inflation has been a political headache for the White House and President [Joe Biden](https://www.cnbc.com/joe-biden/).

Administration officials pin most of the blame for the surge on supply chain issues related to [the Covid pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/), imbalances created by outsized demand for goods over services, and [the Russian attack on Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html).

In  a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Biden said he will push for further  improvements to supply chains and continue efforts to bring down the  budget deficit.

However, he and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  both have emphasized that much of the responsibility for lowering  inflation belongs to the Fed. The administration has largely denied that  the trillions of dollars directed toward Covid aid played a major role.

How  much the central bank will have to raise rates remains to be seen.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers recently released a white paper  with a team of other economists that suggests the Fed will need to go  further than many are anticipating. The paper asserts that the current  inflation predicament is closer to the 1980s situation than it appears  because of differences in the ways that CPI is computed then and now."|0.98|2593.0|0.0|2593.0|['Dow Jones', 'Fed', 'Wall Street Journal', 'MI2 Partners', 'the White House', 'Treasury', 'CME Group', 'the Federal Reserve', 'the Bureau of  Labor Statistics']

t3_v9113e|1654841239.0|investing|Opening up Pandora’s box of ETF distributions|"Hi guys,

So I went down a little rabbit hole in terms of ETF distributions to see what truly lies behind the red curtain of these gizmos. I made a couple findings that I found to be quite striking and had a few questions about them, and would love to know your thoughts.

1. What’s the true essence of ROC, are there limits to it, and if so what are they?

Take for instance these two funds, ZDV and ZDI. 

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zdv-bmo-canadian-dividend-etf/

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zdi-bmo-international-dividend-etf/

One is a Canadian dividend fund and the other is an international dividend fund, same product maker though which is BMO.

If you look at distribution history for both, ZDV - Canadian one - has been flat in terms of distributions (since 2020).

On the other hand, ZDI has seen big cuts in terms of total distributions in the same time frame.

In the case of ZDV, distribution from dividends were cut, either due to the funds re-balancing *or* underlying securities cut *or* a combo of both.

*However* the total distribution was left unaffected due to ROC masking the cut in dividends.

On the other hand, distribution from dividends actually *increased* for the other fund, although total distributions actually *decreased*! This was because the fund cut ROC.

This left me confused and hence raises the question, why? The entire point of ROC if understood is to have some stability in monthly distributions. Instead of weird numbers like 5234 one month and 6,700 next and 6k next month after that, ROC comes in as a buffer of sorts to smoothen out distributions. So why in the world would they decide to cut it? 

This leads me to believe that there’s limits to ROC and how much can be used. If true, I’m curious to know - in seeking to assess funds in the future - what that limit is…

2. How does a fund asses capital gains distributions?

This is in regard to covered call ETFs, premiums are considered to be capital gains. Yet, take a fund like ZWC, and strangely enough there’s zero distributions coming from capital gains!

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zwc-bmo-canadian-high-dividend-covered-call-etf/

Surely it’s not because they didn’t sell any calls, that defeats the purpose of the fund. So why are there no capital gains? 

The only other source of distribution here - other than dividends - is ROC. 

This leads me to believe that ROC is not only “your cash coming back to you”. It has more powers than we give it credit for.

My theory is that for whatever reason, the fund has decided that the capital gains for whatever reason have become ROC. Is this possible? If so, why would they do this? Also, wouldn’t this break the idea that ROC is just your money back to you? It can also be capital gains too - hidden capital gains in a way.

3. Dividend cuts from covered calls do not make sense?

Compare ZDV the Canadian dividend fund linked above, and ZWC it’s covered call counterpart:

https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/advisors/zwc-bmo-canadian-high-dividend-covered-call-etf/

From 2020 to 2021, distributions *specifically* from dividends for both funds got cut by around 20%. 

I don’t get how this is possible. When you buy a covered call ETF, you have the added risk of getting called away for your securities meaning your distributions from dividends would get cut. This is *in addition* to the risks of cutting from things like re-adjusting the portfolio, or underlying securities cutting dividends, or both. 

Wouldn’t this mean then that both of the covered call ETF would have much more of a cut than the other one all else being equal?

You might say who cares? Well this all leads to my theory about ROC. This is the only other variable that seems to explain all of these strange things happening to distributions. Either that or I’m just completely missing something…

In any event, would love to know what you guys think about all of this!

Thanks in advance.

Edit: I’m not looking to discuss the dividend irrelevancy theory, don’t bother.

Leaving distributions aside, the global dividend aristocrat ETF has been flat more or less for 10 years.

My question is, what would the share appreciation look like on a covered call version of said index?

One the one hand, part of me thinks if the non-covered call version is flat, the share appreciation on the covered call version would be negative.

On the other hand, the other part of me thinks it would also be identically flat?

If I have a basket of securities and sell covered calls on them but don’t re-invest premiums or dividends and instead keep it as cash, the share appreciation would look identical to a strategy in which one didn’t use a covered call strategy no?

t3_v8uqwl|1654819773.0|investing|Why do people say covered calls are “safer” than normal dividend ETFs for retirement?|"Hi guys,

Why do they say this? They claim it’s safer in the sense that the distributions are not as volatile. 

Is this true?

Dividend aristocrats have a track record of increasing for 25 years. 

We don’t really have a track record of gradual consistent increases in premiums from selling calls for 25 years now do we?

What happens if markets collapse hard and fast? People have said that the covered calls would outperform, but is this really true?

If the markets entered a depression, people would be less willing to give you a high premium for a call as the market is so put friendly at that point.

The fund will thus have a slash in premiums from covered calls meaning your distributions get slashed too!

Even on the upside, say we have an extreme crypto like run up, the fund managers may have to cut back on selling calls in order to prevent so many securities from getting called.

Distributions would thus get slashed in this case too!


Unless ROC would mask these extreme events, and all three of these components would work in tandem flawlessly more so than a normal dividend etf would which only has ROC and dividends. Not sure tbh…

What do you guys think?

Thanks.

t3_v8u9ue|1654818345.0|investing|Questions re ROC in the event of an ETF dividend cut?|"Hi guys,

I was wondering, say you decide to invest in a US dividend aristocrat ETF and then we enter a depression of sorts whereby the aristocrats cut by 30%.

Usually, some well designed funds will have some ROC every month comprise the ETFs distributions to make the monthly income look stable. So instead of 5k one month 2k another 6k the next, it’s 5k all year long and anything left/increase is given on the last month of the year.

Here’s my question though, are there limits to ROC in the event of a massive dividend cut by the funds underlying securities? 

Like say XYZ fund wants to maintain a consistent dividend increase and doesn’t want distributions to get cut by 30% which will spook the ETF holders. They instead decide to mask the 30% cut with ROC, until markets recover and they slowly pull back the ROC as the dividends increase again.

My question is, are there limits to how far they can mask with ROC, if so how do we know what that limit is?

I assume the ROC comes from the cash reserve of the fund? Like when you buy into it, part of the cash you gave the ETF is kept on reserve as cash for purposes like ROC right? Can the fund simply sell underlying securities to increase cash position and increase ROC? (I’m not talking about adjusting for allocation, I’m saying selling out to increase cash reserves) I don’t think so as that would be capital gains or loss, unless ROC can be these things as well?

Sir John Templeton, the investing pioneer had famously said, ‘This time it’s different’ statement is very dangerous. It is very apt for investors – if you often start hearing ‘This time it’s different’ you should start getting worried.

Why do people say ‘This time it’s different’ ?? Because there’s no other way to prove that they are right. This time it’s different can have many interpretations in the markets –

4 most dangerous words in Investment world

1) Making the same mistakes again 

Investors tend to make the same mistakes again or make the mistakes other investors made earlier. They do not learn from mistakes. When markets are rising, they feel that “it will be different this time” and do not remember the crash earlier.

For example, in the year 2000, the dot-com bubble and some market manipulation led to the indices zooming upwards. Retail investors bought stocks at high prices. Then the Sensex lost 2000 points in 3 months leading to big losses for retail investors. They did not evaluate the market well. They went along with the herd to buy stocks without understanding the fundamentals.

In 2007, FIIs invested a huge amount in India, this led to a rise in the stock markets – valuation ran much ahead of the fundamentals. Investors again made the mistake of buying at high prices with the reasoning that “this time is different” as there are no dot-com movements and big institutions are investing. Media started publishing articles India needs Infrastructure &amp; real estate blah blah so ‘This time it’s different’. In 2008, the stock market crashed and investors lost again.

No body was ready to invest in 2008 end because they thought ‘This time it’s different’ – the world is going to end.

Investors feel that this time it is different and they will not make the same mistake again. But this is a delusion.  Investors will lose money when they believe without any concrete evidence that ‘this time it’s different’!

2) Historical Returns are important 

Past performance is not indicative of future returns – Most mutual funds and investment houses put forward this disclaimer. But past performance (I am not talking about recent past but historical data) is an important parameter to consider while investing. You cannot ignore historical performance by saying “it is different this time”. It gives some idea of the investment and the trend of returns given by the investment.

3) Valuations always matter 

There will be different bubbles and market conditions that will come and go. But the valuation of investments will remain in place. At different times, the market will be influenced by different conditions. But if your investments have been chosen after careful research, solid fundamentals and good management, the investments will stay on course in the long run. But be frank retail investors don’t have such capacities. It will be better if they have their investment policy statement &amp; stick to that in all season. [ PE Ratio is one of the valuation methods – there are many others ]

4) Human Greed 

Usually retail investors are not able to overpower greed and fear when they invest. This is not different in any part of the world. They try to put all their money in one outperforming asset. They do not exit (rebalance) from the asset at the right time in a bullish market expecting more and more gains and end up losing money. Others fear losses and do not invest in the market at all till their friend bought a car after selling scooter. Some people hold on to bad investments as they are scared of losses.

It is good to want to optimize your returns and be cautious in the market. But at different times there will be different reasons for volatility in the market. It is important to recognize that and attach the requisite importance to valuation.

---

I would just emphasize point #3, as IMHO it is the foundation for this post.  Most people who believe ""This time it's different"" believe that how we fundamentally value the market has changed.  Sometimes this is an opinion based upon research, but many times it's simply because the people uttering the phrase don't know anything about investing, and thus don't appreciate or understand what fundamental valuation is."|0.85|123.0|0.0|123.0|['FIIs', 'Infrastructure &', 'IMHO', 'PE Ratio']

t3_v7hhri|1654664856.0|investing|Why it isn't too late to buy refining stocks|I have been reading a lot about refining and it seems like the problems are here to stay. If anyone is unaware a large part of the high gasoline prices we are seeing is thanks to refining margins going through the roof. The 3-2-1 crack spread which is the margin that a refiner makes on converting 3 barrels of oil into 2 barrels of oil and 1 barrel of diesel has rocketed to over $50 a barrel when pre-covid they usually sat around $20. Refining has been an area that has seen consistent low investing and Europe's refining capacity has been diminishing for over two decades. The remaining capacity in Europe is largely configured to refine Russian oil, is often owned by the Russian companies and is often positioned to receive Russian oil via pipeline. Refining capacity in the US is also shrinking although to a much lesser extent than in Europe. The last oil refinery constructed in the United States was completed in 1977 although other refineries have been expanded since then. Refineries that process more than 10,000 barrels of crude oil a day are on average 83 years old. Industry insiders say it could take ten years from the start of the process for a new refinery to come online so this doesn't seem like an investment that anyone is going to want to make. Lyondell Basell will be closing a large Houston Refinery by the end of 2023. Overall it seems likely that margins are going to stay elevated for the remainder of oil's relevance. For the year 2021 HF Sinclair($Dino) had a 3-2-1 crack spread of $21 and as I mentioned earlier the spread now is over $50. This should provide a significant boost to profits. I'm not sure about other companies but the company is projected to generate 1.5 billion in free cash flow without the increase priced in. At a current EV of 14.6 billion FCF/EV is under 10.

The Biotech industry has been hit particularly hard by the broad market decline. The SPDR S&amp;P Biotech Index is down over 50% from it's February 2021 peak. The FDA has been rejecting a record amount of companies. A few years ago, 60% of clinical trials were positive. That number has dropped to less than 20% as of late, signaling the ease of funding for companies whose science was too early-stage. The explosion of publicly listed biotech companies recently seems to be a signal of mania, but mania produces overreactions, and overreactions present opportunities. Just over 20% of companies listed on the Nasdaq Biotech Index are currently trading for below cash.

The space should be approached with extreme caution. While many companies are trading at negative enterprise values, much of those that are, only have 2 years of cash left. Rising rates could hasten the rate of cash burn, and refinancing or issuing new debt may be very difficult or impossible.

I know this is a fairly broad  question, but any advice would be appreciated. What determines the difference between buying high and selling low vs cutting loses on a proven loser?

My wife's 401k dumped her international index fund (think something like VXUS) and outomatically switched her into Baron Global Advantage Fund Institutional Shares. It is clearly not even closely an equivalent - basically a high risk 2/3 US, 1/3 international, tech, growth, emerging market type fund. We just left it, as her 401k had no other international options. Yes, this was our mistake and fully understand how we should have done things differently to approximate our desired asset allocation and risk tolerance. Initially, I assumed this was basically similar to VUG, but the more I look at it, I feel its closer to some wannabe ARKK thing. Expense ratio is high at 0.9%, but almost all my wife's options are 0.5% or more.

Anyway, how do you determine when its time to cut and run, after taking a BIG loss? I did ask this on bogleheads, and got a bit of a mixed bag, but the overall sentiment was to dump it. My only issue with that sub is that a lot of the advice seems all hold to a few basic rules, such as only buying the absolute lowest cost funds, or just parroting blanket statements that don't really help analyze a portfolio. A lot of times it seems they will recommend dumping a fund based on expense ratios, without taking into account things like tax implications (although this doesn't apply to my 401k issue). Anyway, I am not arguing with their advice, but would be curious what /r/investing has to say. I've seen some similar posts here that have been allowed, but if this violates any rules, you don't need to give specific advice on this fund, but maybe references or discussion on how to evaluate larger funds where it might not be feasible to evaluate each individual holding individually, as well as when to hold through the dips vs cutting your losses."|0.74|20.0|0.0|20.0|['Global Advantage Fund Institutional Shares', 'BIG']

* CEO Brian Cornell said the big-box retailer wants to clear room for the merchandise including groceries and back-to-school supplies.

* Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That’s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago.

* The company also reiterated its forecast for sales growth and said margins will look healthier in the back half of the year.


Target warned investors Tuesday that its profits will take a short-term hit, as it marks down unwanted items, cancels orders and takes aggressive steps to get rid of extra inventory.

The retailer slashed its profit margin expectations for the fiscal second quarter to account for a wave of goods winding up deeply discounted or on the clearance rack. Shares fell about 1% in early trading Tuesday.

“We thought it was prudent for us to be decisive, act quickly, get out in front of this, address and optimize our inventory in the second quarter — take those actions necessary to remove the excess inventory and set ourselves up to continue to be guest relevant with our assortment,” CEO Brian Cornell said in an interview with CNBC.

By taking swift action, Cornell said Target can fend off further pain and make room for merchandise that customers do want, such as groceries, beauty items, household essentials and seasonal categories like back-to-school supplies. He said the company’s stores and website are seeing strong traffic and “a very resilient customer,” but one who no longer shops popular Covid pandemic categories.

“We want to make sure that we continue to lean into those categories that are relevant today,” he said.

Target anticipates its operating margin rate for the second quarter will be around 2%. That’s lower than the outlook it gave less than three weeks ago, when it anticipated its operating margin rate would be roughly around its first-quarter operating margin rate of 5.3%.

In the back half of the year, Target anticipates profit margins will be in a range around 6% — better than its average performance for the fall season in the years before the pandemic began. The company said it still expects revenue growth to be in the low to mid single digits for the full year and to maintain or gain market share in 2022.

Retailers from Walmart to Gap face a glut of inventory as inflation-pinched shoppers skip over categories that were popular during the first two years of the pandemic. Gap, for instance, said customers want party dresses and office clothes instead of the many fleece hoodies and active clothes the company has. Walmart said some families are making fewer discretionary purchases as the prices of gas and groceries rise. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters both reported a steep jump in inventory levels, up 46% and 45%, respectively, from a year ago from a mix of items not selling and supply chain delays easing.

The extreme shift in consumers’ spending habits comes as retailers start to get back to healthy in-stock levels. That means some have an abundance of sweatpants, throw pillows and pajamas just as consumers search for swimsuits and suitcases. Plus, some shoppers are trimming back on spending due to inflation or putting more of their dollars toward experiences like dining out and traveling.

Cornell said Target decided to roll out its new inventory plan after hearing retail competitors had similar woes. He said the company also wanted to get ahead of key sales seasons, such as back-to-school and the holidays, when stale merchandise could clutter stores and drive away customers.

Target said it had nearly $15.1 billion of inventory as of April 30, the end of the fiscal first quarter. That’s about 43% higher than in the year-ago period.

Target shocked Wall Street on May 18 with a wide earnings miss for the fiscal first quarter, as it got hit by fuel and freight costs, higher levels of discounting, and a rotation away from items like TVs, small kitchen appliances and bicycles. Its shares fell nearly 25%, marking the company’s worst day on Wall Street in 35 years.

Walmart missed earnings expectations, too. Its inventory levels were up about 33% compared with a year ago. Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said at an investor event on Friday that about 20% of that is merchandise the retailer wishes it did not have. Roughly a third is additional inventory to help the retailer restock key items. He said it will be “a couple of quarters to get back to where we want to be.”

That company’s shares also fell after Target’s announcement on Tuesday. Walmart’s shares were down about 2% early Tuesday morning.

Cornell said Target is sorting through its inventory, deciding in some cases to pack away merchandise to sell at full price in the future and in other cases to promote or come up with ways to sell through it now.

For instance, he said, Target had a big sales event over Memorial Day weekend to clear bulky outdoor items like patio furniture out of its backrooms. It also got additional space near U.S. ports to hold merchandise, so it has a place to move goods — some of which are arriving too early or too late."|0.95|572.0|0.0|572.0|['Target', 'Abercrombie &', 'CNBC', 'Cornell']

Quantum technology should be viewed as a critical enabler for industries in the future with applications including better methods of drug discovery and modeling financial markets. Nonetheless, the quantum industry is still in a very early stage. Almost all the companies outlined in this article are yet to generate material revenue from quantum technology. Over the past decade these companies have been growing out of research labs, taking on both government and private financing and committing to fundamental research to develop truly novel technologies. An investment in any of these quantum computing stocks relies on a fundamental judgment call: that we can build useful quantum computers.

Almost all of the quantum computing projects/pipelines generate trivial or zero revenue from such offerings today, and are better thought of as long-term R&amp;D projects to enable future business divisions. For example, you shouldn’t forget that Google makes its money from advertising and cloud services. With that said, if the quantum computing addressable market lives up to the hype, having a position in one of these could be a reasonable bet.

A sufficiently powerful Quantum Computer may be able to intercept many forms of modern communication we currently take for granted as being provably secure.  Quantum Security refers to both, using new types of cryptographic protocols and algorithms that are thought to be secure against a Quantum Computer and using fundamental quantum mechanical principles to secure data. 

Arqit (NASDAQ: ARQQ) is a quantum security company founded in 2016 and headquartered in London, UK. The business went public through a SPAC earlier this year and is now publicly traded. Arqit provides SaaS Quantum encryption solutions. Their source of entropy will eventually be from a satellite and symmetric key data will be stored in global data-centers. Their focus has been on building corporate partnerships with blue-chip clients.

Quantum eMotion (TSXV: QNC), is a Montreal-based developer of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) founded in 2017. QRNGs are hardware components that leverage the intrinsic unpredictability of quantum mechanics. Their purpose is to create pure randomness to ensure encrypted communication is “unhackable”. The business recently announced a patent issuance in China. 

Hub Security (TESA:HUB) is an Israeli company redefining cyber security by using quantum-powered secret computing and has been awarded FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification, the highest level of security for cryptographic modules in the United States. Hub protects critical commercial and government information in over 30 countries by providing revolutionary cybersecurity computing solutions and a wide range of cybersecurity professional services. Recently, the company agreed to merge with SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition Corp. (RNER) on March 23 to go public in the United States.

So why invest in quantum computing? Let's summarize, you’ll get well-diversified exposure to the quantum computing industry before it gains widespread commercialization. Quantum computers are the next leap forward in computing power. Using the power of quantum mechanics to solve certain problems, quantum computers can do things that even the biggest and best classic supercomputers in the world cannot. This nascent technology creates multidimensional spaces to represent very large problems. Quantum computers can even perform certain tasks in about one second that would take a classic supercomputer a week to perform. Given the technology's potential, it's certainly understandable why investors are excited about the future of quantum computing"|0.71|13.0|0.0|13.0|['quantum', 'Quantum Security', 'Quantum eMotion', 'Arqit', 'TSXV', 'Quantum', 'FIPS', 'QNC', 'SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition Corp.', 'Quantum Random Number Generators', 'quantum mechanics', 'Google', 'Quantum Computer']

&gt; It’s a “real wake-up call,” says Desiree Fixler, the former DWS executive who blew the whistle on her company for allegedly making misleading statements about ESG investing in its 2020 annual report (DWS denies wrongdoing). “I still believe in sustainable investing, but the bureaucrats and marketers took over ESG and now it’s been diluted to a state of meaninglessness,” she says.

&gt; On top of the allegations of greenwashing at the industry’s highest levels, there is the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is forcing companies, investors and governments to wrestle with developments that at times appear to pit the E, the S and the G against one another. For example, governments in Europe are reneging on environmental goals by turning to fossil fuels to reduce dependence on Russian gas, in order to fulfil ethical goals.

[...]

&gt; Some people wonder whether the term still has any meaning at all. “The acronym ESG is a bit of a confused compact because it muddies at least two things,” says Ian Simm, founder and chief executive of £37bn asset manager Impax Asset Management, a pioneer in sustainable development.

&gt; “One is an objective assessment, around risk and opportunity. And the other is around values or ethics. And so people get themselves tied in knots because they’re not really clear about what exactly ESG investing is about.”

The idea being that with the global financial economy being so interconnected, think 2008, 2020, and now. Does it really matter if we diversify only in US stocks, or alternatively, if we only bought Canadian stocks?

Plus, many large companies have parts of their company in different countries anyway, so in a way, you are already diversified no?

Thoughts?

Note: before you pull out a graph and say economy “x” only accounts for 5% of the global economy and what not: 

1.

I’m curious to know how you can truly determine that. Remember that a “Canadian” company does not only operate in Canada, same idea applies to the US. Do we really have an accurate way of measuring the reach of these companies? 

2.

Why does this matter? “Diversification for the sake of diversification bro” well that’s a circular argument. So long as the population, economy of that country is growing whether it be from births or immigration, the big players make their money and can continue to grow. You have your eggs in a developed country with strong institutions compared to other countries, why diversify out into some countries that are arguably not as developed in this respect? In a way, we can view this as *less* diversification if diversification is all about risk aversion. 

I guess volatility is lower by a bit, total returns though is probably a little lower for the lower risk though.

# Weekly Brief for the Coming Week of 6/6/22

**The Week Behind**

Courtesy of Friday’s sell-off on the backs of MU and AAPL, all the major indices closed the week in the red. DOW down 0.9%; NASDAQ down 1.0%; S&amp;P down \~1.2%.

Highlights:

* Jamie Dimon appeared to have flip-flopped as the CEO turned weather forecaster called for anything from a category 1 hurricane to a “superstorm Sandy” after proclaiming the clouds were clearing the week before.
* Markets grappled with the 10-year retesting 3%.
* Indices reacted poorly to PMI, but positively to mixed employment data.
* The Chinese economy began reopening.
* Microsoft (MSFT) revised earnings downward as a strong U.S. dollar weighs on multinationals (FX revision).
* Bearish calls on Micron (MU) and Apple (AAPL) as DRAM prices appear to be deflating, and Apple’s app store is suffering due to slowdowns in China.

Although Friday’s session was poor, overall, the market continued its recent trend of ending up despite bad news. On Wednesday, we traded down as QT began, sending the 10 year close to 3%, and May PMI came out to 56.1%, suggesting the economy may still be hot enough to warrant additional FED tightening. However, the indices recovered pretty well by the close. On Thursday, it was MSFT’s downward FX revision and FED Vice Chair Brainard reiterating her hawkish position that caused an AM sell-off. However, by midday a bounce was underway that had enough energy for all three of the major indices to close convincingly at weekly highs. Friday, downgrades to AAPL and MU resulted in a down open without a bounce. However, the major indices refused to give back gains made in the prior week’s rally. In short, while the indices did not stage a bounce to close the week, the indices showed some resilience by refusing to fold.

**Is The Rally Intact?**

In my view, the rally is still intact, but there now arise fair questions surrounding how much steam remains. With the 10 year below 3%, S&amp;P holding 4,100, plenty of bad news priced in, and earnings holding up, I think there is more room for upside. Furthermore, it appears that the 10-year yield and investor appetite are largely dependent on the FED’s tightening path. Assuming the FED doesn’t deviate from its planned 50 bps hikes at the next two meetings, I think the market is range bound pending data relative to the FED’s action in September. Do we see a 25, 50, or 75bp hike? Do we see additional reduction of the balance sheet? Economic indicators, bellwether earning reports, and “FED Speak” is our best source of additional insight. *Given year-over-year comps for CPI get easier for the latter half of the year, there is reason to believe the FED will have some leeway to slow tightening, which is bullish for equities.*

**The Week Ahead**

Speaking of economic indicators, this week features consumer credit - 3pm, Tuesday - initial and continuing jobless claims - 8:30am, Thursday - and CPI - 8:30am, Friday. Consumer credit will provide insight on how households are handling elevated levels of food and energy inflation. A poor reading may create the perception the FED will remain aggressive in September. It would also give reason to sell consumer discretionary. As per jobs, we want a middle-of-the-road number. Too hot, the FED needs to do more to slow the economy. Too cool, the economy is falling into more than a slowdown. CPI, we want a cool core and headline to permit less aggressive action in September.

As per earnings, Dave and Buster’s (PLAY) reports Tuesday after the bell. A good number would suggest consumers are spending on “experiences”. Campbell (CPB) reports Wednesday before the open. It is considered a safe-haven in the current environment and part of an exclusive club of stocks that are positive YTD. Otherwise, Thursday after the bell is DocuSign (DOCU). The stock has been cut in half YTD. I think this company has legs post-COVID; however, it will need to deliver a compelling post-pandemic plan or commentary to change its perception as a pandemic-darling.

As previously mentioned, I think the market’s primary concern is FED action in September. Remember, the FED promised to be data dependent beyond the June and July meetings. The FED’s move in September is dependent on the health of the economy and state of inflation as illustrated through all of the data leading up to September’s meeting. While this week’s data is important, it only begins to set the table for the FED’s next move. Most simply, the FED will not be making final decisions on September based on this week’s data. I issue this reminder because the market will react in the moment, and you can expect FED members to do the same via interviews and press releases. *Don’t let an extreme response from either cause you to make an emotional decision with your portfolio.*"|0.76|10.0|0.0|10.0|['Microsoft', 'DocuSign', 'bell', 'DOCU', 'Micron', 'PMI', 'NASDAQ', 'FX', 'CPB', 'MU', 'Apple', 'The Rally Intact', 'AAPL', 'FED', 'MSFT']

International

Small Cap Value.

Why these two choices?

International hedges against the potential total loss / underperformance of Capitol should the United States end up experiencing a lost decade. 

Small Cap Value, disregarding the long proven trend that it outperforms the market longs term, also tends to rebound quicker and out perform the S&amp;P during the beginnings of a recovery period.

Both of these asset classes have done poorly during the last decade which has made many hesitant; but that just increases my conviction that there will be a rotation into them soon and that all the reasons why they may outperform will be demonstrated soon as the US flounders through this situation.

See:

The 1970s

The 1980s

The 2000s

But I always get downvoted for suggesting this because the only asset classes that seem to matter on this website are either the speculative tech plays or VTI and chill.

Lastly;

IEMG is only down 13 percent YTD, VXUS 11%, and IJS 7%. While you’re still losing money somewhat, this counts as “outperforming” the broader market.

t3_v5rdyz|1654478230.0|investing|Can someone elaborate on non-cash distribution from ETFs and its effects??|"Hi guys,

[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/education/article-whats-with-etf-distributions-that-dont-distribute-any-cash/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/education/article-whats-with-etf-distributions-that-dont-distribute-any-cash/)

So according to the above article, there are some ETFs out there that distribute part of their yearly distributions as non-cash distributions, I have so many questions that arise from this:

1. Why in the world would they do this? Isn't an ETF simply meant to give you the dividends from the underlying securities? How, where, and why would they distribute  non-dividend distributions?
2. Is this a sign of a healthy ETF, it depends, or no?
3. What are the tax implications of this? Say you invest 1000 dollars into ABC ETF at 5% yield, 2.5% of that yield is non-cash distributions. Do you pay tax on that portion on the year of or only when you sell? How are the taxes calculated?
4. What would this *look* like in terms of your ETF? Let's go back to the 1000 dollars into ABC at 5% example. Say each share you bought at 10 bucks, so you now have 100 shares. 5% yield means your distributions amount to 50 bucks. If half of that is non-cash, does that mean your ETF will magically increase the number of shares you own to 25 bucks more, so assume it is still 10 bucks a share, meaning an extra two shares? But what happens with that 5 bucks you can't re-purchase with? This all would happen without DRIP being turned on right which is weird to me. So basically your yield in cash is not actually 5%, you can get finessed and only get half of that in cash right?

Currently, I have a majority of my investments in an ETrade brokerage account. Recently, I looked into Roth IRAs and decided that opening one was a good idea. The question now becomes how should I distinguish between these?

Also, for context, I have a strong 401k as well so we are strictly talking excess investments/retirement savings here. 

What do you guys do? Should I treat both the same? Should I have investments in one that I don't have in the other? Should I keep the IRA well diversified, contribute steadily, and forget about it - keep the Etrade account as a separate entity and hold some of the same ETFs?

t3_v5oz2p|1654470301.0|investing|Derivative dividend ETFs are LESS risky than normal dividend ETFs???|"Hi guys,

So first off, I'm not interested in debating the dividend irrelevancy theory. For those with a long retirement horizon, sequence risk is a big issue, and dividends from aristocrats have historically been less volatile than the overall market.

That being said, I'd like to have a discussion as to whether a global derivative dividend aristocrat ETF is actually LESS risky compared to a global non-derivative dividend aristocrat ETF.

For someone looking to draw a monthly income from the distributions, you want something that is stable month-to-month and grows at least with the rate of inflation.

That being said, to my shock, a derivative based one seems to fit this criteria better than a non-derivative one???

Compare for instance the following:

[https://ycharts.com/companies/TQGD.TO/dividend](https://ycharts.com/companies/TQGD.TO/dividend)

https://dividendhistory.org/payout/tsx/TGED/

These ETFs are very similar, the main difference is that the top one is non-derivative while the second is.

To my shock, the derivative one has MORE growth in terms of distributions and MORE stability, whereas the top one actually CUT their distributions?!?

My question is, how can this be possible? Wouldn't the addition of derivatives make this higher risk? Further, the yields are similar, the derivative is like 1% higher, meaning the majority of the yield comes from dividends. I don't get how the derivative overlay makes the ETF less risky overall. Can someone explain why? Am I missing something?

Note: I know a derivative ETF has slightly less returns in the long term, that it has higher expenses, but these are not what I'm wondering.

Thanks in advance."|0.71|24.0|0.0|24.0|[]

Investors commonly hear that when inflation surges, it is best to put your money into physical assets that track the jump in prices, with real estate often suggested as the best option. But physical assets, particularly properties, generally can’t be bought as easily or quickly as securities, and acquiring them often entails significant transaction costs.

The second-best option is usually to rebalance your stock portfolio to shift it into industries that do well in an inflationary environment. So, when inflation surges, what industries do best for a stock portfolio?

To sum up: Shares in real-estate investment trusts or companies in the real-estate industry are not the best option. Stocks in the materials and energy industries outperform all others by a long shot, according to the findings of a study I conducted with my research assistants, Zihan Chen and Yiming Xie.

The median real-estate stock delivered a 3.32% annualized return over the three periods, far below the annualized returns of 18% for the median energy company and 16.81% for the median materials company.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, healthcare (including pharmaceuticals) performed the worst, with an annualized return of minus 8.44%, followed by consumer staples at minus 6.73%, consumer discretionary at minus 5.71%, utilities at minus 4% and technology at minus 3.64%.

The negative results for healthcare, tech and consumer discretionary are understandable, because these are interest-rate-sensitive industries. But the results for consumer staples and utilities might surprise some investors, because these are often thought of as safe assets in rough times.

At the end of the day, the best move for investors who want to reposition their portfolios quickly when inflation is surging is to shift into materials and energy companies."|0.87|183.0|0.0|183.0|['healthcare']

Dividend bearing equities tended to do fairly well, ie., holding them and doing nothing made you noticeable money, but the massive multipliers were to be had in the stocks that grew independently of any dividend policy for the most part. 

Strong, market-bucking gains in value were either in companies that produced massive profits like Apple, which produced enormous wealth from its lowly shares if you bought them on the cheap, or simply experienced multiple expansion like most of the NASDAQ and much of the S&amp;P 500 regardless of their constituent dividend policies. I can think of a few dividend focused companies that have done better than the S&amp;P in this time-frame assuming dividends were reinvested, but I can't think of any one of them that did better than Apple or Google on their own.

Most of this stuff is over my head, and if anyone can clarify more, please correct my statement, and give better explanation.

There was a lawsuit against Tenneco for investigation into possible breach of fiduciary duties in connection  with the sale of TEN to affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. for  $20.00 in cash per share of TEN owned.

I joined in on this lawsuit, and my lawyer got in touch with me today and all other share holders to inform of good news that Tenneco withheld some information, or wasnt quite honest with everything they were saying, or what they were supposed to be doing.  However, what was made transparent now will leave the shareholders more at ease in making their vote on June 7th to agree to the amount of 20 dollars per share.

Right now Tenneco is going for 17.27 a share..  So there is money to be made there if one wishes to take that risk or chance to make 2.73 per share you buy...

t3_v3nk6f|1654217792.0|investing|Oil to GDP as an indicator of deeply troubling times (don't worry, we're not there)|"**Oil to GDP** 

I think a useful ratio for indicating deeply troubling times is world and US oil expenditures to GDP. The last two great market tops for oil were in 1980 and 2008, which were periods that saw some of the deepest recessions in history. Oil is still one of the bedrocks of our economy, and when it gets too expensive, spending pulls back across much of the market. Here are some previous ratios of Oil to GDP and at what percentages it historically preceded market tops and subsequent financial turmoil. 

**1980**

In 1980, oil peaked at 36$ per barrel. In 1980, the US consumed 17 million barrels per day, totaling 6.205 billion barrels a year. At 36$ per barrel, this equals $223.38 billion of oil consumption. GDP in 1980 was $2.857 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 7.81% of US GDP. The world consumed 61.23 million barrels per day (YCharts) totaling 22.3489 billion barrels per year. At 36$ per barrel, this equals $804.5622 billion against a world GDP of $11.3 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 7.12% of world GDP. The country entered a recession in 1981-1982 which was, at the time, the worst economic downturn in the United States since the Great Depression. The Dow lost 20% from peak to trough.

**2008**

In 2008, oil prices peaked at 145$ per barrel. The US consumed 19 million barrels per day, totaling 6.935 billion barrels per year. At 145$ a barrel, oil expenditures would amount to $1.005 trillion against GDP of 14.5 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 6.93% of US GDP. World consumption during this time was 86 million barrels per day equaling 31.39 billion barrels per year. At $145 per barrel, world oil expenditures would amount to $4.551 trillion against world GDP of $58.06 trillion, making oil expenditures equal 7.83% of world GDP. The country entered a recession in 2008, which is currently the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The S&amp;P lost 50% of it's value from peak to trough. 

**Presently**

In 2021, the US consumed about 20 million barrels per day, totaling 7.3 billion barrels per year. Using today's price of oil ($117; WSJ), oil expenditures equal $854.1 billion against US GDP of 23 trillion (Current dollar GDP), which makes oil expenditures equal 3.67% of US GDP. World oil demand was 99.7 million barrels per day, totaling 36.3905 billion barrels per year. At $117 per barrel, this equals $4.2576 trillion in oil expenditures against world GDP of $94.935 trillion (Statista; 2021), making oil expenditures equal 4.48% of world GDP as of the end of 2021. 

**In Closing**

We are trending upwards, but oil expenditures to GDP have a ways to go before reaching the 7-8% figures we've seen during previous financial catastrophes. There are many nuances to oil prices, but for us to reach even the 7% figures of Oil to GDP, the price per barrel of oil would need to reach \~$220/ barrel. (I’m not sure it’s this simple, but I’m trying) Now, $220/barrel seems ridiculous. The price of oil would certainly start to have hampering effects on economic growth before this level as it did with previous price run-ups,  but my point is that we could potentially see oil go much higher before we see a market top and subsequent collapse.

I am not aware of a good software to use in order to track a portfolio of equity, fixed income and crypto. This would be a performance measurement tool and ideally the holdings would be an aggregation of trades. I am looking to house and consolidate investments in one tool – being able then to have an “easy” overview of cost, performance, holdings… and dare I say it, risk!

Please list your recommendations and anecdotal information (pros and cons).

Ideally the software offers a monthly subscription, accounts on a money-weighted return and can produce reports from it. 

Morningstar portfolio management tool does not accept individual fixed income ISINs or identifiers, so this would be an example of not what to suggest.

I am unsure about the cost of SS&amp;C Geneva, but this looks like a good solution.

Something along these lines, ""affordable"" as an individual - e.g. does not exceed $1,000 per year would be good - but I am open. 

There is also Clearwater Analytics, Kubera, Personal Capital - and may others, I am just unsure about their capabilities versus cost. 

Separately, if anyone knows where I can find a library of valuation spreadsheets which I could download/pay for, in order to value a multi-asset class portfolio effectively and correctly, please suggest so!!

However, if a CEO of one of the largest cautioned about the stock market and economy. I am beginning to be concerned.  This week we are getting mixed messages about the stock market or even wonder if it is a solid place to park your savings.  Never have us seen an aggression that seems to last that long with no relief or truce insight. The inflation certainly has hit hard started with fuel prices.  I started seen $7 prices at gas pump and summer just started.  I plan to reduce my positions and put into more in recession resistant funds. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS and PLANS?

Below is the article from JP Morgan CEO. 

“It’s a hurricane. Right now, it’s kind of sunny, things are doing fine. Everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,” Jamie Dimon [said during a financial conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ9ycHsXOls).

“That hurricane is right out there down the road, coming our way. We just don’t know if it’s a minor one or Superstorm Sandy or Andrew or something like that, and you better brace yourself,” he added.

The JPMorgan Chase chief executive spotlighted two issues he was concerned about: the Russia-Ukraine war and how it is affecting rising prices for fuel and food, and the Fed’s efforts to raise interest rates and reduce its balance sheet to tackle inflation, [according to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/jamie-dimon-says-brace-yourself-for-an-economic-hurricane-caused-by-the-fed-and-ukraine-war.html).

Dimon said “wars go bad” in suggesting that the Fed’s interest rate hikes could backfire and lead to a recession.

He also said the U.S. should do more to protect European economies that are being hurt by the fighting over Russia’s oil and gas supplied.

“We’re not taking the proper actions to protect Europe from what’s going to happen to oil in the short run,” he said.

The chief executive’s remarks come as the United States grapples with decades-high inflation, a nagging COVID-19 pandemic that has disrupted supply chains and further constraints on the global economy from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The Biden administration and the Fed have come under criticism for not doing more earlier to tackle inflation.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [conceded in an interview with CNN](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3507422-%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Byellen-says-she-was-wrong-about-path-that-inflation-would-take/) on Tuesday that she was “wrong” about the trajectory of inflation following comments she made in 2021 that suggested it would be a “small risk.”

My HSA provider is currently changing banks, and I am being forced to liquidate my HSA investment in order to transfer the funds over. I'm not upset by this, but I'm upset by the new bank's fee structure.

The current bank charges no fees for HSA investing as long as you keep your cash account at a minimum of $3000. The new bank charges at least 0.40% annually, and an additional 0.50% for a ""Managed Path"" (rather than Self-Directed Path or Brokerage Path, neither charge the extra fee). The 0.40% comes out to about $35-$40 per year for my current investment balance, and maxes out at $120. 

I'm looking for some guidance on whether I've just been spoiled with a fee-free investment account, or if this is not worth re-investing my HSA cash considering the new fee structure. Keeping it all as cash would generally earn about $4 in interest each year. 

Also, if anyone can tell me if the extra 0.50% annually would be worth it for a Managed Path. Previously I had it in a Self-Directed patch invested in a target date retirement fund.

So the Fama-French 5 factor model states that the difference in returns between two portfolios is explained (mostly) by 5 factors: market beta, profitability, size (large vs. small cap), growth vs. value, and investment style (aggressive versus conservative).

Now consider a 100% VT portfolio. Would this portfolio be 'undiversified' in a factor sense, since the returns are explained entirely by market beta? (even though technically you own all equities)

To then gain exposure to the size factor, you would *overweight* small cap stocks and therefore increase return. Or you could overweight value stocks to get the value factor. This means you have diversified into two factors?

But how do you diversify across *all* factors? How much small caps, value stocks, profitable stocks, and conservative investing-style stocks do you need to add? If you just end up at 2 * VT, you are back to just one factor (market beta). But you can't *only* buy small, value, profitable, conservative-style stocks or else you lose market beta.

My other big question is: based purely on factor models, how do you calculate the 'optimal' allocation? Consider the set of all portfolios with a fixed risk allocation--the expected returns are (ideally) explained by the factors. What are those weights?

&gt; Come September, the Fed will be cutting $95 billion a month from its holdings, split between $60 billion of Treasuries and $35 billion of MBS.

&gt; That is roughly double the maximum pace of $50 billion a month targeted in the 2017-2019 cycle. Back then, the split was $30 billion of Treasuries and $20 billion of MBS.

&gt; When the Fed kicked off its first-ever QT undertaking, its total balance sheet was around $4.5 trillion in size. In nearly two years of QT, it managed to bring that down by about $650 billion to a bit over $3.8 trillion before it brought the program to a stop.

&gt; This time, the annualized monthly rate of reduction works out to more than $1.1 trillion a year in balance sheet roll-offs once it attains its maximum pace. That means it will likely surpass the total of the entire 2017-2019 QT cycle by early 2023. Many economists see officials targeting about $3 trillion in total balance sheet shrinkage over a three-year span.

t3_v1xdvn|1654023332.0|investing|LETFS can have a responsible use case|"Hi all,

This sub had a recent thread that seemed to turn into a total echo chamber on this subject. I spend most of my time trying to tamp down the excessive optimism in r/LETFs but from what I saw irrational pessimism on these instruments is dominant here. So lets discuss, hopefully in good faith. I enjoy debating the merits of this stuff, so I intend on posting more here in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

(1) **Daily rebalancing is in and of itself a cost.** This is one big myth. As AQR points out: "" Levered portfolios require an additional  rebalancing process, but this does not cause  any special “drag” effects beyond the normal  compounding effects of investments at a similar  risk level, and some additional transaction  costs  Moderately levered portfolios of liquid  instruments can be suitable for long-term  investors, subject to their risk preferences."" All these examples of ""market goes up 10% then down 10%"" that show LETFS losing money due to so called drag involve the market mean reverting within the period described, which is tantamount to saying swing trading would beat the market! Rebalancing, aside from costs involved in doing so, is not a source of greater returns, or a market timing strategy would work. There is absolutely 0 reason to say that daily rebalancing should in general lose to, or beat, monthly rebalancing. If you have a view on that, you have a view on timing the market.  

(2) **3X leverage is needed to generate high returns.** I spend much of my time in the LETF subreddit debunking this nonsense. It is indeed true very few markets are high enough returning and stable enough to reward 3X leverage. But 2X leverage does dramatically increase returns, more than quadrupling average lump sum ending balance over 30 year periods from 1920-2021, and more than tripling DCA balances over 30 year periods from 1920-2021 (less time to compound dillutes DCA advantage) based on Robert Shiller's monthly data assuming a borrowing cost of the Fed Funds rate+85 basis points. One annoying aspect of the current LETF market is that 3X levered ETFs are cheaper than 2X levered ones, such that half in UPRO half in VOO beats all in SSO. But 85 basis points, roughly 45 per turn of leverage in management fees and 40 worth of spreads is quite reasonable as an approximation for UPRO. Download Shiller's data and assume higher fees and spreads if you want to stress test, I've done so a great deal. Even many of the more bearish users such as Modern Footblal in r/LETFS admit that 2X leverage with reasonable stock market returns does increase ending balance. 3X leverage is a whole different ballgame. 

&amp;#x200B;

(3) **There is no tax advantage to leverage** This is a key point very few people talk about. UPRO has had a tax cost basis WAY lower than SPY or VOO. This is analogous to the interest tax shield in corporate finance/private equity. They use the dividends to pay the interest costs, thus avoiding the need to distribute capital gains. Most backtests don't account for this, which arguadly would reduce CAGR of SPY/VOO by as much as 0.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) **Historically US equity returns continuing is needed for leverage to work** I actually made a post in the LETF sub pointing out Shiller's arguments that we should adjust down historical stock market returns to reflect the fact that most economists don't think the US stock market performance will be repeated. But 2X leverage still handily wins in maximizing ending balance over long periods, both with DCA and lump sum, if you adjust down historical returns 1% or 2%. Moreover, the fed funds rate is unlikely to average 3.7% as it did in the past, more like 2% seems likely as a long term average, so leverage is far more likely to be rewarded. 

(5) **Risk adjusted returns are all that matter in investing.** I readily admit that LETFS will always have slightly worse risk adjusted returns than SPY, at least ignoring potential tax alpha. But if you are just looking to maximize your money far in the future, and have a good emergency fund and confidence in your ability to earn enough money to support your lifestyle, risk adjusted returns aren't necessarily the most important thing to you. If you for instance are a FIRE type DCAing into UDOW and UPRO will probably get you there quicker than SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's enough for now. I genuinely believe that the current LETFS will be a much more important area of finance in the future given it looks like low interest rates are a long term thing, and I welcome an honest discussion about them."|0.78|42.0|0.0|42.0|['SSO', 'UPRO', 'Fed', 'DCA', 'LETFS', 'SPY', 'VOO', 'Shiller', 'LETFs']

&amp;#x200B;

Between the start of the month and May 24, insider buying at S&amp;P 500 companies has been the strongest since March 2020, according to figures from VerityData. For the broader Russell 2000 index, there have been more insider buyers than sellers this month for the first time since March 2020, VerityData said.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite retail investors pulling out of the stock market and the looming threat of a slowdown or recession, “corporate insiders are holding a non-consensus view across most sectors and \[are\] actively buying the dip”, analysts at JPMorgan said in a May 27 note, adding that the share purchases were encouraging for the direction of stock markets.

[Line chart: Net insider buying](https://archive.ph/Xoram/8b7ad801524416a019e2e59407135fd8bb58963c.avif)

&amp;#x200B;

US stocks snapped a seven week losing streak on Friday although the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is down 12.8 per cent so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Strong insider buying “has historically been a pretty good sign of market bottoms”, said David Giroux, portfolio manager at T Rowe Price.

&amp;#x200B;

“Insiders are saying ‘we don’t see a massive event coming’ . . . \[that\] these are really good buying opportunities,” he added. “This is just another confirming data point that should be positive for the market over six to 12 months if not longer.”

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this month Howard Schultz bought $15mn of Starbucks shares after returning as interim chief executive in March to the company he turned into a global coffee chain. It was the first insider stock buying at Starbucks since August 2018, VerityData said. Starbucks shares are down about 35 per cent so far this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Vladimir Shmunis, co-founder and chief executive of RingCentral, a web-based app company that replaces landline phones, spent $1.2mn on his first stock purchase since the company went public in 2013. RingCentral has seen its share price plunge more than 60 per cent this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Representatives from Starbucks and RingCentral did not respond to a request for comment.

&amp;#x200B;

“There is certainly message sending \[with\] buying and some of it is performative,” said Ben Silverman, research director at VerityData.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Silverman said that he would have expected “more intense buying right now”, especially at S&amp;P 500 companies.

&amp;#x200B;

“In March 2020, no one had any clue how the next two years would play out,” he said, adding that at the start of the pandemic “we saw a lot more \[buying\] conviction”.

As a side note, I'm not really interested in the merits of I Bonds and such, but really want to know the nuances in what is possible.

So it seems you could double your purchase limit within a household if you take advantage of gifting. To start, you can buy $10k for yourself and every member of your household. Then you can buy $10k in GIFT bonds for your spouse and vice-versa, as long as you transfer it in a future year that they do not purchase or receive any. If you have kids, after purchasing their $10k limit for the year, each parent can purchase an additional $10k as a gift for that child as long as it is transferred and staggered to be given in a year they did not reach the limit.

The benefit would be to maximize the purchase ability for this year's rate, while sacrificing the purchase ability in a future year. But this sacrifice is irrelevant, considering that inflation may come down, and then one can transfer the i bond in that year.

So, for example for a family of 3, a scenario can be as such:

Parent 1 - Purchase $10k for themself, purchase $10k gift for their spouse, purchase $10k gift for child

Parent 2 - Same as parent 1

Chid: Parents purchased $10k limit for the year

Totalling: $70k in I bonds for the year under the current rate

The problem is that only one of the conditions for a rally is in place, that everyone’s scared. That worked beautifully for timing the start of the 2020 rebound, but this time around may not be enough.

The other requirements are that investors start to see a way through the challenges, and that policy makers start to help. Without those, the risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don’t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence.

This time central bankers are scared not by falling markets or the economic outlook, but by ***inflation.*** Sure, if something major breaks in the financial system, they will refocus on finance, and a recession may prompt them to rethink rate rises. But for now, ***inflation means that falling stock prices are seen merely as a side effect of tighter monetary policy, not a reason to invoke the “Fed put” and rescue investors.***

There is nothing magical about a fall of 20%, the usual definition of a bear market. But it does crop up a lot: In the past 40 years, the S&amp;P 500 has bottomed out with a 20%-or-so peak-to-trough decline four times, in 1990, 1998, 2011 and 2018. Another four times it had far bigger losses, as true panic took hold.

***The common factor in the 20% drops was the Federal Reserve. Each time, the market bottomed out when the central bank eased monetary policy, with the stock market’s fall perhaps helping push the Fed to take the threats more seriously then it otherwise might.***

My concern is that this time could be more like 1973-1974. Just as then, the primary concern of the country is inflation, thanks to a war-related oil-price shock. Just as then, the inflationary shock took hold when the Fed had rates far too low given the scale of political stimulus for the economy. Just as then, favored stocks—the Nifty Fifty, now the FANGS and associated acronyms—had soared in prior years.

Most important, in 1974 the ***Fed kept raising rates even as a recession took hold because it was running to catch up with inflation. The result was a horrible bear market interspersed with soul-destroying temporary rallies, two of 10%, two of 8% and two of 7%, each snuffed out. It took 20 months before the low was reached—not coincidentally, when the Fed finally began to get serious about cutting rates.***

To be clear, this article is not predicting a bear market, just saying that conditions are almost optimal for one to occur.  The market can of course stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent if you bet against it.  Regardless, ***Don't Fight the Fed***."|0.5|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Fed', 'the Federal Reserve', 'FANGS']

And since the stock market is a measurement of the sentiment for the future, not the present, shouldn't the stocks rise soon again? What is holding the bulls back? The war in Ukraine? Should also be temporary. The inflation? If you ask economists, this is mainly caused by the aformentioned supply crisis and the resulting huge supply/demand imbalance.

It was an awkward time to be a keynote speaker at a conference for money managers: Wood’s flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF, had lost roughly half of its value over the prior year, as its aggressive bets on hot companies from Coinbase to Robinhood and Tesla had melted down amid a bear market in tech stocks.

So far, she’s been wrong — her main fund is down another 34 percent since her comments — but her firm still has more than $16 billion in assets, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. 

Still, over a period of years, stocks do tend to go up. But even if the tide eventually turns back in Wood’s favor, other investors are questioning whether the self-styled futurist has a future in stock-picking, given the volatility that has become her hallmark. After all, Wood, what some call a “permabull,” could be merely the epitome of the broken-clock parable — guaranteed to be right twice a day.

Money she sorely needs for her retirement, which is going to be next year. My mother is very ignorant of what should be done with this money, but luckily she hasn't touched it since getting it. With the recent downturn in the market, she sees the loss on her balance sheet, is panicking, and finally has let me see it.

$325,000 in a beneficiary IRA account with LPL financial. Looking at her statements, there appears to be a few dozen equities (about 25%) and the rest in various mutual funds and ETFs. There also appears to a significant (~$1300) monthly fees on each statement. Earlier in the month, she was sufficiently spooked by the fees and market fluctuation to liquidate all the above into cash in the account.

Her on again off again boyfriend who is a nice guy and a tax preparer is recommending her putting the balance of the inheritance in American Funds (which, transparently, he represents.) There would be an appox. $7,000 load fee to buy in. 

* Am I right that the expenses are high for the IRA?
* American Funds is NOT a good place for her to move the money, right?

My employer offers 401k match/6% and I also have an HSA through them

I've been trying to better understand money in general and have been looking into lowering my tax bracket 

My projected annual gross this year should be roughly 82000

A quick Google search shows me that - for year 2022

$10276 - $41755 is 12%
$41776 - $89075 is 22%

If im understanding correctly, if I were to finish the year at 82000 even, 
I would pay 10% on the first $10,275
Pay 12% on the next $31480
Pay 22% on the remaining $40,245

If i did the math correctly


Now if that is correct, I would have to reduce my taxable income(through 401k/hsa contributions etc) by 40k to avoid the 22% tax on roughly half of my gross salary for the year? It just feels like I'm missing something or not understanding correctly

Google did not give me answers I wanted which brings me to you.. 

When I switch my contributions to 401k from Traditional to Roth or vice versa, what happens? My employer is using fidelity, and I can see that there was no new 401k account created when I made this switch. 

\- Does this mean that my traditional, and Roth contributions are consolidated into one account under my employer? 

\- Does fidelity keep track of how much of the funds in the same account are pre-tax vs post-tax? I was not able to find any info on my account.  

\- For IRA, I need to create a separate account for Roth and Traditional, right? I'm basically expecting similiar behavior for 401k but I'm still seeing only one account for my employer and it's not clear to me whether this account is Traditional or Roth.

I was also thinking about only paying off 75% of it as I have a very low interest rate (3%) and investing the rest when the market bottoms out. Thoughts?

Edit: thanks for all the comments y’all. This forum seems to be very evenly split across 3 options: 

1. Pay whole mortgage off
2. Pay some mortgage off (including option to recast), invest some (50/50)
3. Invest all (DCA/conservative investments)

I went ahead and used 66% of the gain to pay down my mortgage and will invest 34% more in I-bonds, DCA, and another investment arm I have access to. This was close to my original plan and was somewhat validated by this forum.

The house I am in right now as my primary is not my forever home, but my forever home will undoubtedly cost more so I’m comfortable putting a large sum of money towards the mortgage since that housing expense will be larger in the future when I eventually trade up anyway. Better to have more of a principal paid off for when I trade up in the future as well since interest rates on a future home will be sky high. (I live in the highest COL area in the world btw.)

t3_uzoxcy|1653749575.0|investing|The Benefits of Diversified Investing across different Asset Classes - A simple backtest of a low-risk portfolio through all market conditions|"Hope this post might be helpful particularly for newer investors or people that want to invest but aren't really comfortable with the level of risk on equities, or who struggle to push their money in because they are afraid of a downturn soon after. I want to show you that you can still achieve good returns with low risk. In fact your risk-adjusted returns can be clearly superior.

We all know that stocks tend to offer the highest possible returns in the long run, but the problem is that stocks come with a level of drawdown risk &gt;50%. This can be very problematic for people who are not comfortable with the idea of high drawdown. It is even more problematic for people who think they are comfortable with high risk but then find out when it happens, that they are not. This puts you at risk of committing the cardinal sin of investing – which is cashing out at a hefty loss, and not only locking in a loss, but locking yourself out of future recovery and eventual gains. 

Every investor must honestly appraise the level of risk they are taking and find a level which they are genuinely comfortable with in order to avoid the cardinal sin. The problem that creates is that you have to compromise on expected returns, but IMO too many people don’t properly explore the middle ground and understand the compromise can be net beneficial and individually tailored to suit.

Diversifying between asset classes exposes you to different levels of return and risk, but critically offers you assets which are uncorrelated or perhaps somewhat negatively correlated. This leads to the so-called ‘diversification gain’. The diversification gain is essentially the benefit you receive by never taking a massive drawdown. It is better to be taking moderate returns on a consistently larger amount of money than higher returns on a potentially much smaller amount of money. Perhaps not in terms of absolute return in the long-long run, but we’ll come to that later.

So what are the asset classes we are going to look at? I have chosen US Stock Market, US Intermediate Term Treasuries, Gold, and Cash. The comparison is simple – we’ll look at 100% stocks (the high benchmark), 100% cash (which will show you why you need to invest), and a balanced portfolio. The balanced portfolio is 45% US stocks, 32% treasuries, 8% gold, and 15% cash.

Now, before any jumps on me – yes, that is conservative. And yes, there are other classes that could be included, and yes this weight to that or that weight to the other might be ‘better’, but not the point of the post. The point is to simply look at the benefit of diversification on risk control and the compromise on returns, and what can be achieved even with a conservative approach, which I personally found surprisingly good.

I will just say a word about cash, though – the idea of cash being there is because most people, especially risk-averse people, do want to keep some cash and there is often a real-life potential need for it (unemployment, unexpected expenses etc.). It is also surprising how good the returns can be in spite of keeping cash. Further, it avails you of rebalancing opportunities, something 100% stock investors simply do not have, but I’m not going to get into that here and I’ll mention why at the end.

The backest will be done as far back as it can be done on [this tool]( https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/), which is 1972. It is very helpful that we can go back to the 70s, because we can walk through a period of high inflation and tightening monetary policy. Too many backtests only look at the post-1987 easy money era, or even the post-2008 QE era. These tests will give misleading results if the monetary conditions change. However, I’ll also show results for those to show the compromise is not too great.

So, [these are the portfolios]( https://imgur.com/a/dD5iBhS). Portfolio 1 – 100% stocks, Portfolio 2 – the balanced approach, Portfolio 3 – 100% cash (which is cash earning about what it would in a savings account btw). Portfolio 2 is rebalanced annually.

And [these are the results from 1972 until April 2022](https://imgur.com/a/PgAR4TL) – a 50 year investment horizon.

Your eyes are perhaps jumping right to the final returns, but this isn’t where they should be. Why? Firstly, you cannot be 100% stocks into retirement otherwise you are risking &gt;50% drawdown on the day you retire, and if that happens you aren’t retiring. You are going back to work until that 50% is back one way or another (or slightly less considering you get older in the meantime). If you’re relying on the market, good luck, you now need it to go up 100% to make your money back and this might take a long time.

The second reason is that you can still achieve the same return by stretching the investment horizon out, i.e. you consciously accept you might have to retire a few years later, but that your date will be better known, and your life will be much less stressful. It is impossible to chase early retirement by constantly pursuing high returns without risking much later retirement. A sensible rebalancing strategy towards conservative assets as you get close to retirement is the best approach, but again it’s not going to be covered here.
In this case, a 59 year investment horizon instead of a 50 year investment horizon would approximately equalize the returns between portfolios 1&amp;2. This is not in itself desirable, but what do you get for it?

The key is the lower drawdown. Portfolio 2 risks 20%, portfolio 1 risks 50%. That is a huge difference. And what is the difference in growth? Portfolio 1 has a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 10.5% and portfolio 2 has a CAGR of 8.9%. So really, that’s a lot of extra risk for a small overall improvement in performance. It is true that bit extra makes a big difference in the end, but then you have to face the problems of the previous paragraphs.

What really strikes me is the smoothness of portfolio 2’s equity vs portfolio 1. It’s just a pretty much constant gain with only gentle drawdowns. Look at the Sharpe and Sortino ratios. The Sharpe ratio is measure of deviation from risk-free return, the higher the deviation the lower the Sharpe. The Sortino ratio is similar but only considers downside risk – it shows how much excess return you are getting per unit of risk (if we consider risk to be drawdown) – in my mind it is the more useful indicator here.
What is also notable is that there have been periods where portfolios 1&amp;2 have approximately equalized. In 2008, portfolio 2 actually became the better performer, 36 years after the start of backtest. That’s kind of incredible considering the respective risks. Astonishingly, this result still occurs if you start the backtest at a very favourable time for portfolio 1, which I’ll show below. 

A word on data-framing. So yes, in 1974 there was a big downturn on the stock market and maybe it’s not fair to start the backtest in 1972. So let’s make this very flattering for the stock market and start in 1988, after the 1987 crash, and heralding the start of the modern easy money era with Greenspan deploying QE and the Fed put for the first time.
[It’s really not that bad for portfolio 2]( https://imgur.com/a/SBBsw9j). Portfolio 1 has a notably higher CAGR, but still much greater risk, and the Sharpe and Sortino ratios indicate portfolio 2 is the better risk-adjusted performer. And again, there was a period of merging the last time the stock market suffered. And this is if we really frame portfolio 1 favourably. 
[Now let’s do the opposite, and compare since the top of DotCom in 2000]( https://imgur.com/a/DNPpGmi). Portfolio 1 still has it’s nose out in front, but only fairly recently, and the smoothing which portfolio 2 provides is now starkly apparent. Look at the consistency of portfolio 2’s curve (and remember, there is 15% cash in here, during an era of historically low rates!). Portfolio 2 is clearly the best risk-adjusted performer. The Sharpe and Sortino ratios are incomparably better.

By now you should see that in all conditions a balanced approach yields moderate-good returns with low drawdown, whereas all equities offers a higher CAGR but at the expense of much greater risk. Assessed by risk-adjusted return, the balanced approach is clearly superior.

So that’s about it really. I’m aware that we can tinker with this and that, but my point is just to show what diversification brings, and the returns that can still be had even with a very conservative weight that includes 15% cash and 8% gold.

I hope it helps some people who aren’t really sure what to do by giving them some perspective and a viable approach. If you buy portfolio 2, you sleep well at night, you don’t worry and you don’t make mistakes. You make moderate amounts of money most of the time, and you risk only about 20%. You can keep your investments liquid and draw on them if needed. You also have a consistent approach to take to retirement. Further, you can also think about rebalancing strategies, which if performed well, can even further improve portfolio 2, but I am going to leave this because it’s not necessary and is timing to some degree. I’d encourage you to play around with the portfolio tool if you want to tweak it to something which is perfect for you personally.

The check for the rollover was mailed to me when the SPX was around $3900, and I just now got the check into the settlement fund of my IRA, so I am in an all cash position at the moment. The market just had two strong rallies where the SPX is now at $4158. It seems I missed those gains if I put the money into VOO or some target date fund right now.

Should I still get back into the market ASAP? It seems this recent rally could be a bear market rally that will later reverse to new lows, but how confident can anyone really be about that? Am I better off waiting to see? If the market doesn't test new lows and keeps going up, I'll be kicking myself.

It seems like interest rates rise a fraction of a percent, and the stock market drops 10%.

Even if that fraction of a percent interest rate were to slow the economy a few percent, why do so many sell their stocks?  I've heard other interest bearing investments might seem more lucrative, but I don't get it.  If the stock market historically gains about 10% on average, isn't it still way better than taking it out and putting it in some significantly lower interest bearing investment that now pays 0.5% more than it did before?

I've become extremely interested in energy markets since the onset of the Covid Pandemic. I've become so amazed that such a critical lifeblood of the economy and humanity could briefly trade negative. My interest has led me to start building positions in E&amp;P companies, base metal miners, precious metal miners, uranium producers, and agricultural companies (both fertilizer and seed/agricultural chemical companies.) 

You may feel like the time to invest in such companies has passed given the recent run-ups in commodity prices, but I believe the time to do so is just beginning. I believe the true nature of shortages, especially in energy markets, haven't and won't fully materialize until \~2025. As shortages in energy markets materialize, prices will run up more than anyone expects. 

As an extension of price run-ups in critical fuels and feedstocks, further price run-ups will occur in food and fertilizer markets, agricultural chemical markets, industrial gas markets, base and precious metals markets and to try and combat price increases across critical goods, the US will begin to heavily invest in E&amp;P and refineries for the first time in more than a decade. I believe companies with hard assets providing inelastic goods will, unfortunately, be the best performers through the decade.

**Energy Abundance**

For the last 10 years, we have lived through one of the most energy-abundant periods in history. This energy abundance has come primarily from the productive capacity increases of the US stemming from the shale revolution. 

The US has gone from exporting \~2000 barrels a day in 2010 to over \~8000 barrels a day as of 2021. The same goes for Natural Gas. In 2010, the US exported 1,173 bcf of Natural Gas. That number has ballooned to over 6,653 bcf of Natural Gas today. 

Never before has the US focused it's natural gas production efforts in so few fields. The Marcellus, Haynesville and Permian Shale Gas formations account for over 50% of US Natural Gas production. The Permian Oil field in Texas accounts for \~50% of oil production as well. 

**Field Lifecycle**

*Goehring and Rozencwagj published this info in their quarterly letter, I'm just summarizing. This is not my research.* 

Just like every other Natural Gas (and oil) formation in history , production ramps up, plateaus, and then dramatically declines. The Barnett and Fayetteville fields had estimated total reserves of 23 tcf and 10 tcf respectively. Both fields produced half of their estimated reserves around 2013. Barnett peaked at 5 bcf/d in \~2013 and then began to slowly decline to 2 bcf/d today. Fayetteville peaked at 3 bcf/d in \~2013 and then began to decline to 1 bcf/d today. 

A concept I've only recently learned, and was made aware of by a natural resource fund I follow, Goehring and Rozencwagj, is known as the Hubbert Linearization. It estimates the logistic growth rate and the quantity of the resource to be recovered. Historically, oil and gas producing fields have plateaued after half of their recoverable reserves have been extracted. Production would ramp up before reaching a peak, plateau at the peak for roughly 2 years, and then would begin to decline mirroring the ramp-up phase creating a bell-shaped curve. 

According to the Hubbert Linearization, The Marcellus formation will eventually recover 135 tcf of Natural Gas. To date, 65 tcf have been extracted, which means we may start seeing a plateau as early as this year and declines in 2025. The Haynesville field is harder to estimate as their production was tempered down for a period and then ramped back up again. Estimates from the quarterly letter, however, put recoverable reserves at 73 tcf with 30 tcf extracted to date. Given current production, 50% recoverable reserves are estimated to be reached in 2023 and declines will begin in late 2024. 

**Convergence of US and International Natural Gas Prices**

Europe has historically paid higher energy prices. This is due to them not being able to come close to meeting domestic demand with domestic production, making them and Asia net importers. The US on the other hand has enjoyed ultra-low natural gas prices since the start of the shale revolution in 2006. 

To put this in perspective, the price of US Natural Gas hasn't been above $10 per mmBtu in the last 10 years. Europe on the other hand, given the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, hit $45 per mmbtu while Asia reached nearly $75 per mmBtu. This is $300 barrel of oil equivalent and over $400 barrel of oil equivalent, respectively. 

Because the US is able to produce all of it's domestic needs and import some from other cheap producers, we've essentially lived on a price island, remaining insulated from international prices. Any meaningful slowdown in Marcellus, Haynesville or Permian production will quickly cause US prices to more closely match international prices. This makes natural gas producers particularly attractive as equity holdings, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. 

**Interconnectedness of Fossil Fuel and Food Markets**

Natural gas is a critical feedstock for industrial gas markets, and by extension, fertilizer and food markets. Natural Gas and coal are used to create the inputs needed for the Haber Bosch Process. The Haber Bosch Process is the main industrial process for the production of ammonia. 

Through a process called Steam Methane Reforming, Natural Gas and steam (and pressure) are reacted to separate hydrogen from carbon to create hydrogen gas. Hydrogen and Nitrogen from the air are fixed in a high pressure, high heat environment (around 800 degrees fahrenheit, also heated by coal or nat. gas) with a catalyst (usually iron or nickle) to create liquid ammonia. The liquid ammonia is then used to create the nitrogen-based fertilizers our world depends on. Approximately 3-5% of the natural gas produced globally is utilized for ammonia production. This figure represents nearly 1-2% of the global energy supply. Approximately 1.2% of the world's energy is used for fertilizer production, of which 93% is nitrogen-based fertilizer (because it is the most effective.)

Crop yields are responsible for our cooking oils (also dependent on fossil fuels, since hexane is used for solvent extraction) and our production of animal protein. As economies industrialize, populations begin moving from grains to protein, and to produce this protein, large crop yields are needed to produce animal feed. 

Another critical shortage the world is experiencing is diesel. Diesel is the most efficient fuel for producing high torque at low-rpm, which makes it the best option for powering farm machinery as well as long-haul trucking. The covid recovery saw demand snap back with a vengeance, so transportation demand spiked to ease supply chain issues. To properly refine diesel, gas is needed to produce hydrogen, which is used to de-sulfur distillates so it can be used in engines. With pricey natural gas, diesel is getting more expensive to refine. 

Another agricultural price increase occurring as a result of higher energy prices is ""glyphosate,"" the main ingredient in the weed-killer round up. Roundup is used by farmers nationwide to tend their field in farming off-seasons, and the potential damage to fields from skipping a season could be great. 

At a time when Russia and Belarus' potash and potassium is removed from world markets, Ukraine is predicted to miss a harvest entirely, and protectionist policies are beginning to run rampant, fertilizer and agricultural chemical companies will, unfortunately, enjoy significant pricing power, since food is the most inelastic good of all. 

**In Closing** 

I'd love for a day to come when we no longer need to rely on fossil fuels, but I believe we've gone about trying to minimize them in the worst way possible. Europe is especially feeling the pain now, as their focus on rolling out solar and wind farms, while simultaneously shutting down nuclear power plants, has left their country in an energy deficit. The US has pledged 5 bcf/d to try and make up for the shortfall in Russian energy, but meeting this demand has significant logistical challenges. Both Europe and the US will be in a horrible spot if there is a slowdown in any of our top fields. 

Natural gas transports very differently from oil. It isn't extracted in liquid form, so it must be chilled and liquefied at special facilities, transported on LNG carriers that can keep it in liquid form, and regassified at special facilities at the destination so it can be burned for energy. Both Europe and the US are short the ships, the liquefaction, and the gasification facilities. Europe seems to be in a painful spot, especially if harsh winters are on the horizon. 

Bear markets have a way of returning capital to it's rightful owners. Our era of easy money is coming to an end, so the days of capital chasing the stocks of unprofitable companies is also coming to an end. I believe the US will need to invest significantly in E&amp;P over the next decade, and companies with hard assets will outperform for the foreseeable future."|0.55|6.0|0.0|6.0|['Haynesville', 'LNG', 'The Haber Bosch Process', 'the Haber Bosch Process', 'the Hubbert Linearization', 'International Natural Gas Prices', 'nat', 'US Natural Gas', 'Permian Shale Gas', '\\~2025', 'Natural Gas', 'Nitrogen', 'Hydrogen']
t3_uyzboo|1653661377.0|investing|switching from VEQT to XEQT|"I'm looking at the possibility at swapping my entire portfolio from VEQT to XEQT. I know these funds are virtually the same, tiny bit lower fee for XEQT and a slight allocation difference but it's negligible. The thing that intrigues me is the fact that XEQT has a slightly smaller yield compared to VEQT (from their website, but I see three different reported yields on different apps...) but XEQT pays a quarterly distribution instead of VEQT paying out annually. I like the thought of quarterly better as I can reinvest that money more frequently.

Any thoughts on this?

t3_uyza6h|1653661254.0|investing|Can someone explain I-Bond rates?|"As the title says, can anyone please explain how I-Bond rates work to me? I've visited the treasury site, and it doesn't really make sense to me how they get the composite rate. Please forgive formatting as I'm on mobile.

So the composite rate comes from: 

Composite rate = [fixed rate + (2 x semiannual inflation rate) + (fixed rate x semiannual inflation rate)]

Why is the composite rate not just the fixed rate + semiannual rate? Where do each component in the parentheses come from? Why is it 2 x the semiannual rate, when that rate only lasts for a single semiannual (6 month) period?

Additionally, their historic rates don't match their own equation. I'm pretty decent at math (although I admit I don't know much about finance math), but I've used their equation on a few samples and didn't get their composite rates. Example is May 2009, where the fixed rate was 0.1% (.001), and the inflation rate was -2.78% (-0.0278).

Composite rate = [.001 + (2 x (-.0278)) + (.001 x (-.0278))]

= [.001 + (-.0556) + (-.0000278)]
= .001 - .0556 - .0000277
= -.0546278

So the composite rate for May 2009 SHOULD have been -5.46 percent. Now since I-Bonds never go negative for a composite rate, the rate should have been 0%. According to the treasury website, the composite rate for May 2009 was 9.72%.

Clearly I'm missing something, and I have no idea what it is (am I just messing up my math?).Can anyone please help me understand because I'd very much like to understand this aspect of investing."|0.6|4.0|0.0|4.0|['treasury']

t3_uyvwht|1653649893.0|investing|Why value investing is so effective?|"I wonder which are the invisible forces which make value investing so effective. In fact in the long run the intrinsic value of the company and the market value tend to be the same. In addition following Buffet method you should consider the real business and get your own price and after that make a comparison with the market price, in order to understand if you are overpaying the company. My question is: what is the natural mechanism that make a company that is performing well in the real economy be more and more desirable for the investor. What are the practical elements that bring an investor to invest in a company that is doing well. I would like to understand better this dynamic because until now I tend to apply rather axiomatically the idea that if the company is making earnings you should buy that company, but as I said, I am missing the underlying reasons.
Thanks in advance!"|0.55|3.0|0.0|3.0|['Buffet']
